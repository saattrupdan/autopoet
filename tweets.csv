If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate,24
then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader,21
Sounding more and more like the so-called Whistleblower isn’t a Whistleblower at all,23
In addition,4
all second hand information that proved to be so inaccurate that there may not have even been somebody else,29
a leaker or spy,5
feeding it to him or her? A partisan operative?,15
The Democrats are now to be known as the DO NOTHING PARTY,16
Rep,1
Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions,28
He must resign and be investigated,11
He has been doing this for two years,9
He is a sick man,5

He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call,18
but he completely changed the words to make it..,11
sound horrible,4
and me sound guilty,5
HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT,8
Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public,23
He has been doing this for two years,9
I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud,21

Liddle’ Adam Schiff,5
who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President,24
has just said that the Whistleblower,9
even though he or she only had second hand information,16
“is credible.” How can that be with zero info and a known bias,18
Democrat Scam,4
Adam Schiff has zero credibility,11
Another fantasy to hurt the Republican Party,15
A whistleblower with second hand information? Another Fake News Story,20

Big crowd expected in New Mexico tonight,12
where we will WIN,4
Your Border Wall is getting stronger each and every day — see you in a few hours,22
https://t.co/uuG2gu0tTg,20
In a short while I will be presenting the New York @Yankees @MarianoRivera,24
the greatest relief pitcher (Closer!) of all time,12
with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse,20
They failed on the Mueller Report,8
they failed on Robert Mueller’s testimony,12
they failed on everything else,7
so now the Democrats are trying to build a case that I enrich myself by being President,25
Good idea,4
except I will,4
and have always expected to,8
lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS.,6
for the privilege of being your President - and doing the best job that has been done in many decades,27
I am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening,19
or filling up a gas tank at an airport I do not own,15
These Radical Left Democrats are CRAZY,11
Obama Netflix?,5
“Democrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.” Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are,36
will they “move the goalposts” and,7
is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts,17
but I’ll be able to figure it out,11
Remember when Iran shot down a drone,10
saying knowingly that it was in their “airspace” when,13
in fact,2
it was nowhere close,5
They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie,18
Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia,21
We’ll see?,3
Just Out: “Kavanaugh accuser doesn’t recall incident.” @foxandfriends DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY,35
They are looking to destroy,7
and influence his opinions - but played the game badly,14
They should be sued,4
“What’s happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace,15
This guy is not a good man,7
he is a great man,5
He has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him,27
a disgrace!” Dan Bongino @foxandfriends,11
“The New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.” @foxandfriends The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News,46
This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner,17
the Dems,2
The United States,5
because of the Federal Reserve,9
is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries,19
They can’t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell &amp; the Fed don’t have a clue,23
And now,2
on top of it all,5
the Oil hit,3
Big Interest Rate Drop,6
Stimulus,3
Producer prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to China’s big devaluation of their currency,29
coupled with monetary stimulus,10
Federal Reserve not watching? Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER,23
Really bad for exports,6
No Inflation...Highest Interest Rates..,10
Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you,19
Mr,2
President!),3
we are a net Energy Exporter,10
&amp; now the Number One Energy Producer in the World,16
We don’t need Middle Eastern Oil &amp; Gas,12
&amp; in fact have very few tankers there,11
but will help our Allies,7
The @nytimes,4
“This week,2
the Senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th Federal Judge of Mr,27
Trump’s Administration to a lifetime appointment,14
far outstripping Barack Obama’s pace and fulfilling pledges by Mr,20
Trump and Mr,4
O’Connell to remake the Federal Judiciary...,15
"’These Conservative Judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come,’ said Lindsey Graham",27
Republican of South Carolina,10
who leads the Judiciary Committee and who has been speeding through Trump nominees.” The entire Court System is changing at a record pace,37
House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report,16
sadly for them after two years and $40000000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION,21
ZERO OBSTRUCTION,5
So they say,3
OK,2
lets look at everything else,7
and all of the deals that “Trump” has done over his lifetime,14
But it doesn’t...,5
work that way,3
I have a better idea,8
Look at the Obama Book Deal,8
or the ridiculous Netflix deal,9
Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress,13
"the “Congressional Slush Fund,” and lastly the IG Reports",14
Take a look at them,5
Those investigations would be over FAST,11
“We cannot have what happened to this President happen again.” Joe DiGenova,21
“It is time for Justice to come barreling in.” @LouDobbs Can you imagine that with everything going on in this World,31
the Witch Hunt,3
though on a respirator,7
is still whimpering along,7
A disgrace,3
The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran,16
“No Conditions.” That is an incorrect statement (as usual!),16
Here we go again with General Motors and the United Auto Workers,20
Get together and make a deal,8
PLENTY OF OIL,4
Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked,12
There is reason to believe that we know the culprit,13
are locked and loaded depending on verification,14
but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack,23
and under what terms we would proceed,9
sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied,11
I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States,46
Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia,12
which may have an impact on oil prices,10
I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,21
if needed,3
in a to-be-determined amount...,9
Then,1
on top of it all,5
Kathleen Parker,4
of all people,4
wrote “In Case You Were Wondering,8
Trump Won The Debate.” True,6
but what is going on at the @washingtonpost? NOT Fake News,16
Can’t believe the @washingtonpost wrote a positive front page story,19
“Unity Issue Has Parties Pointing To Trump,12
GOP Goes All In,4
While Democrats Clash Over Ideology &amp; Tactics,16
Mr,2
President,3
We Are With You The Entire Way,9
REPUBLICANS Have....Coalesced Around Trump.”....,11
I am fighting the Fake (Corrupt) News,9
the Deep State,3
the Democrats,4
and the few remaining Republicans In Name Only (RINOS,16
who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation),11
with the help of some truly great Republicans,12
and others,3
We are Winning big (150th Federal Judge this week),19
Can’t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?),40
false allegations,5
and lies,2
This is the game they play,6
Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime,11
#ProtectKavanaugh,7
Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel,13
or the Justice Department should come to his rescue,13
The lies being told about him are unbelievable,14
False Accusations without recrimination,12
When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions,16
Can’t let that happen,6
Thank you @foxandfriends and @RepMarkMeadows,12
Great interview,4
Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for liable,14
or the Justice Department should come to his rescue,13
The lies being told about him are unbelievable,14
False Accusations without recrimination,12
When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions,16
Can’t let that happen,6
Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner,13
the LameStream Media,6
are after Brett Kavanaugh again,9
talking loudly of their favorite word,10
impeachment,3
He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY,15
Such lies about him,5
They want to scare him into turning Liberal,12
All based on NOTHING,5
The Dems can’t get anything positive done,12
and probably don’t want to,8

The Taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now,19
Killing 12 people,5
including one great American soldier,11
was not a good idea,7
There are much better ways to set up a negotiation,15
The Taliban knows they made a big mistake,11
and they have no idea how to recover,12
I’m OK with that,6
https://t.co/LEp2Rv28ge,21
I had a call today with Prime Minister Netanyahu to discuss the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty,38
between the United States and Israel,11
that would further anchor the tremendous alliance...,13
between our two countries,7
I look forward to continuing those discussions after the Israeli Elections when we meet at the United Nations later this month,36
KEEP AMERICA GREAT,6
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party,18
Tuesday night in the Great State of North Carolina proved that high and very beautiful number correct,26
Who the hell is Joy-Ann Reid? Never met her,11
she knows ZERO about me,7
has NO talent,4
and truly doesn’t have the “it” factor needed for success in showbiz,19
Had a bad reputation,7
and now works for the Comcast/NBC losers making up phony stories about me,23
Low Ratings,3
Fake News,2
“A Very Stable Genius!” Thank you,9
While I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes,14
we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL,14
Let’s get counterfeits off the market,10

Great news about the work we are doing on illegal immigration,18
https://t.co/ihTYQAYWxu,17
Historic Milestone indeed,7
https://t.co/Bn0jzvxz9Y,20
The two big Congressional wins in North Carolina on Tuesday,17
Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy,7
have reverberated all over the World,11
They showed a lot of people how strong the Republican Party is,17
and how well it is doing,7
2020 is a big,9
and very important,6
Election,3
We will WIN,3
VERY stupidly negotiated Trade Deals,12
and Illegal Immigration,8
are a tremendous cost and burden to our Country,14
They are BOTH coming along very well and someday,13
in the not too distant future,8
America will see a very positive change,13
Remember,3
America First,5
Illegal Immigration costs the USA over 300 Billion Dollars a year,23
There is no reason for this,7
and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN,17
Democrats could end Loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier,17
and faster,3
But it will all happen anyway!...,9
IG Report,3
which showed him to be a Disgraced &amp; Dirty Cop,13
Republicans have unified like never before,13
You don’t impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job,15
No Obstruction,4
No Collusion,4
only treasonous crimes committed by the other side,14
and led by the Democrats,7
Sad,1
How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers,42
especially for Blacks,5
Hispanics,3
Asians &amp; Women,6
More people working today than ever before,12
Rebuilt Military &amp; Choice for Vets..,11
Became Number 1 in World &amp; Independent in Energy,17
Will soon have record number of Judges,10
2 SC Justices,6
Done more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony &amp; fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him,34
WIN on Mueller Report,6
Mueller Testimony &amp; James Comey.,11
Hello Baltimore,5
https://t.co/Iz2aYj7rrC,19
In fact,2
my views on Venezuela,7
and especially Cuba,6
were far stronger than those of John Bolton,10
He was holding me back,6
https://t.co/FUGc02xiac,17
“This should have been over with after the Mueller Report came out.” @guypbenson @FoxNews,23
“We can’t beat him,5
so lets impeach him!” Democrat Rep,9
Al Green,2
“Dems have never gotten over the fact that President Trump won the Election!” @GOPLeader McCarthy,27
Some really big Court wins on the Border lately,12
It is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products,25
European Central Bank,7
acting quickly,4
Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points,6
They are trying,4
and succeeding,4
in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar,17
hurting U.S,4
exports...,2
And the Fed sits,4
and sits,2
and sits,2
They get paid to borrow money,8
while we are paying interest,8

The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress,23

The Wall is being built after victories against the Democrats in various courts,22

I had an excellent telephone conversation with Andrés Manuel López Obrador,24
President of Mexico,7
talking about Southern Border Security,12
and various other things of mutual interest for the people of our respective countries...,26
The Southern Border is becoming very strong despite the obstruction by Democrats not agreeing to do anything on Loopholes or Asylum,38
on October 1st,6
we have agreed,4
as a gesture of good will,7
to move the increased Tariffs on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods (25% to 30%),31
from October 1st to October 15th,14
At the request of the Vice Premier of China,12
Liu He,2
and due to the fact that the People's Republic of China will be celebrating their 70th Anniversary...,32
BIG United States Supreme Court WIN for the Border on Asylum,17
https://t.co/9Ka00qK1Ob,21
Today and every day,7
we pledge to honor our history,10
to treasure our liberty,8
to uplift our communities,9
to live up to our values,8

to NEVER FORGET,5
#Honor911 https://t.co/3xbEvl92py,32
Leaving the White House soon to speak at the Pentagon,13
My great honor,4
If it weren’t for the never ending Fake News about me,16
and with all that I have done (more than any other President in the first 2 1/2 years!),24
I would be leading the “Partners” of the LameStream Media by 20 points,19
Sorry,2
but true,2
In a hypothetical poll,8
done by one of the worst pollsters of them all,11
the Amazon Washington Post/ABC,12
which predicted I would lose to Crooked Hillary by 15 points (how did that work out?),22
Sleepy Joe,3
Pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the General Election...,23
This is a phony suppression poll,9
meant to build up their Democrat partners,10
I haven’t even started campaigning yet,12
and am constantly fighting Fake News like Russia,12
Russia,2
Russia,2
Look at North Carolina last night,9
Dan Bishop,3
down big in the Polls,5
WINS,1
Easier than 2016,10
The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO,18
or less,2
and we should then start to refinance our debt,12
INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN,9
while at the same time substantially lengthening the term,14
We have the great currency,7
power,2
and balance sheet....,4
The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate,15
No Inflation,4
It is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn’t allow us to do what other countries are already doing,38
A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of “Boneheads.”,21
https://t.co/WqBj8iMQhx,16
“China suspends Tariffs on some U.S,10
products,2
Being hit very hard,6
supply chains breaking up as many companies move,13
or look to move,4
to other countries,5
Much more expensive to China than originally thought.” @CNBC @JoeSquawk,23
Greg Murphy won big,5
62% to 37%,12
in North Carolina 03,7
&amp; the Fake News barely covered the race,11
The win was far bigger than anticipated - there was just nothing the Fakers could say to diminish or demean the scope of this victory,36
So we had TWO BIG VICTORIES tonight,10
Greg &amp; Dan,4
Alice @alicetweet Stewart: Thank you for the nice words while on @CNN concerning the TWO big Republican Congressional victories,37
You’d be great on a network with much higher ratings,14
Keep up the good work,5
https://t.co/eK7swFWq1A,20
@CNN &amp; @MSNBC were all set to have a BIG victory,21
until Dan Bishop won North Carolina 09,12
Now you will hear them barely talk about,10
or cover,3
the race,2
Fake News never wins,5
BIG NIGHT FOR THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,10
CONGRATULATIONS TO ALL,7
Greg Murphy is a big winner in North Carolina 03,15
Much bigger margins than originally anticipated,16
Congratulations Greg,6
Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago,13
He then asked me for help,6
we changed his strategy together,9
and he ran a great race,6
Big Rally last night,5
Now it looks like he is going to win,10
@CNN &amp; @MSNBC are moving their big studio equipment and talent out,26
Stay tuned,2

Senator Ben Sasse has done a wonderful job representing the people of Nebraska,23
He is great with our Vets,7

Ben has my Complete and Total Endorsement,11
I am pleased to endorse Governor Mike Parson of Missouri,16
He is very Popular,7
Strong,1
and knows what he is doing – he gets it,10
Based on the fact that Mike has announced he will run again in 2020 for Governor,25
Mike Parson has my Complete and Total Endorsement,13
Excellent interview by @CondoleezzaRice on @MarthaMaccallum on @FoxNews,24
Very interesting and secure perspective on life,14
One down,2
one to go – Greg Murphy is projected to win in the Great State of North Carolina,22

which was given to me this morning,9
I thank John very much for his service,10
I will be naming a new National Security Advisor next week,19
I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House,23
I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions,14
as did others in the Administration,11
and therefore...,3
Vote today for Dan Bishop,7
Will be great for North Carolina and our Country,14
One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out,36
Many of these polls are fixed,7
or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad,18
Internal polling looks great,7
the best ever,4
ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election,37
When my lawyers protested,7
they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day,19
It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets,19
Sad,1
NORTH CAROLINA,5

We have been serving as policemen in Afghanistan,14
and that was not meant to be the job of our Great Soldiers,15
the finest on earth,5
Over the last four days,6
we have been hitting our Enemy harder than at any time in the last ten years,22
the Economy,5
where there is NO Recession,7
much to the regret of the LameStream Media,12
They are working overtime to help the Democrats win in 2020,21
but that will NEVER HAPPEN,7
Americans are too smart,7
the look of turmoil in the White House,9
of which there is none,5
I view much of the media as simply an arm of the Democrat Party,20
They are corrupt,4
and they are extremely upset at how well our Country is doing under MY Leadership,24
including..,3
A lot of Fake News is being reported that I overruled the VP and various advisers on a potential Camp David meeting with the Taliban,41
This Story is False,5
I always think it is good to meet and talk,11
but in this case I decided not to,10
The Dishonest Media likes to create..,11
The Trump Administration has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country,44
We get ZERO media credit for what we have done,14
and are doing,4
but the people know,5
and that’s all that is important,9
I had nothing to do with the decision of our great @VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg,36
Ireland,3
Mike’s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years,14
and he thought that during his very busy European visit,17
he would stop and see his family,9
I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland,41
and filling up with fuel,7
with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!),16
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME,6
The Trump Administrations has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country,44
We get ZERO media credit for what we have done,14
and are doing,4
but the people know,5
and that’s all that is important,9
that this Administration has done,9
They don’t talk about the great economy,12
the big tax and regulation cuts,9
the rebuilding of the Military,10
“Choice” at our VA,5
our Vets,3
Judges and Supreme Court Justices,9
the Border Wall going up,7
lowest crime numbers,5
2nd A,3
and so much more,4
As bad as @CNN is,8
Comcast MSNBC is worse,8
Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility,19
I believe their stories about me are not 93% negative,19
but actually 100% negative,13
They are incapable of saying anything positive,15
despite all of the great things..,7
Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&amp;T,19
As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN,14
perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible “anchors.” Also,28
I hear that,3
because of its bad ratings,7
it is losing a fortune....,7
But most importantly,6
@CNN is bad for the USA,11
Their International Division spews bad information &amp; Fake News all over the globe,24
This is why foreign leaders are always asking me,13
“Why does the Media hate the U.S,10
sooo much?” It is a fraudulent shame,9
&amp; all comes from the top,7
94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party,18
a record,3
Thank you,2
House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years,22
It forces great people,6
and real leaders,4
to leave after serving,6
The Dems have unlimited terms,8
While that has its own problems,7
it is a better way to go,8
Fewer people,4
in the end,3
will leave,2
but then he ran for Congress and won,9
only to lose his re-elect after I Tweeted my endorsement,17
on Election Day,5
for his opponent,5
But now take heart,4
he is back,3
and running for President of the United States,13
The Three Stooges,4
all badly failed candidates,7
will give it a go,5
When the former Governor of the Great State of South Carolina,17
@MarkSanford,4
was reported missing,6
only to then say he was away hiking on the Appalachian Trail,18
then was found in Argentina with his Flaming Dancer friend,15
it sounded like his political career was over,14
"It was,...",2

vote for Dan Bishop tomorrow,8
We need him badly in Washington,9
His opponent is a far left Sanctuary Cities supporter,17

When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were unable to come even close to getting it done,32
they came to me as a group and asked for my help,12
I got it done with a group of Senators &amp; others who would never have gone for it,23
Obama couldn’t come close...,8
A man named @VanJones68,9
and many others,5
were profusely grateful (at that time!),9
I SIGNED IT INTO LAW,6
no one else did,4
&amp; Republicans deserve much credit,11
But now that it is passed,6
people that had virtually nothing to do with it are taking the praise,19
Guys like boring....,4
musician @johnlegend,7
and his filthy mouthed wife,6
are talking now about how great it is - but I didn’t see them around when we needed help getting it passed,28
“Anchor”@LesterHoltNBC doesn’t even bring up the subject of President Trump or the Republicans when talking about...,33
the importance or passage of Criminal Justice Reform,15
They only talk about the minor players,11
or people that had nothing to do with it...And the people that so desperately sought my help when everyone else had failed,31
all they talk about now is Impeaching President Trump,14

What kind of people would kill so many in order to seemingly strengthen their bargaining position? They didn’t,30
they...,1
only made it worse,5
If they cannot agree to a ceasefire during these very important peace talks,21
and would even kill 12 innocent people,11
then they probably don’t have the power to negotiate a meaningful agreement anyway,26
How many more decades are they willing to fight?,12
Unbeknownst to almost everyone,9
the major Taliban leaders and,9

the President of Afghanistan,9
were going to secretly meet with me at Camp David on Sunday,17
They were coming to the United States tonight,12
Unfortunately,5
in order to build false leverage,9
they admitted to.,5
FAKE NEWS,2
I would like very much to stop referring to this ridiculous story,19
but the LameStream Media just won’t let it alone,14
They always have to have the last word,9
even though they know they are defrauding &amp; deceiving the public,18
The public knows that the Media is corrupt,12
The Failing New York Times stated,8
"in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book),”Even after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama.” THIS IS NOT TRUE",49
I said,2
VERY EARLY ON,5
that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama,10
A BIG DIFFERENCE....,5

The Fake News Media was fixated on the fact that I properly said,19
at the beginnings of Hurricane Dorian,12
that in addition to Florida &amp; other states,14
Alabama may also be grazed or hit,11
They went Crazy,4
hoping against hope that I made a mistake (which I didn’t),16

She is a terrific person with a great future,13
Congratulations to @edhenry and his sister on a great success,19
What a wonderful thing to do,8
I agree with @jimcramer,8
the Fed should lower rates,6
They were WAY too early to raise,8
and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didn’t exactly help either,25
Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well,10
you can’t win them all,6
DACA will be going before the Supreme Court,12
It is a document that even President Obama didn’t feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway,33
Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must,14
based on the law,4
a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all,16
have the discretion to end the program that President Obama began in his discretion,24
That program was unlawful to begin with,11
I think it’s very unlikely that the SCOTUS is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program,37
DACA Is unlawful.” ....,6
President Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA,17
and he indicated so at the time of signing,13
But In any event,6
how can he have the right to sign and I don’t have the right to “unsigned.” Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers,41
The Immigration Law Institute’s Christopher Hajec says,16
“The Supreme Court has to look st whether DACA is lawful,15
What they are looking at now is whether Trump’s recision of DACA is lawful,21
Must consider lawfulness of DACA itself,12
Looks very odd that President Trump doesn’t....,12
“I think President Trump is set in his ways because he doesn’t see any weakening,23
I mean,2
look at the joblessness report today,10
What I’m surprised at is how strong the consumer is,14
I think the Chinese need it (a deal) more than we do,13
It’s statistical,6
I just think...,3
that our economy is very strong,11
If the Fed would lower rates to where the bond market says they should be,17
then I really wouldn’t worry about a recession.” @jimcramer @JoeSquawk,22

wanting to give up on our very successful Trade battle with China,19
which has had its worst Economic year in memory (and getting worse),18
We are taking in $Billions,9

Looking like our great South Carolina could get hit MUCH harder than first thought,20
Georgia and North Carolina also,10
It’s moving around and very hard to predict,13

I am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements,28
Disgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one,12
I gave her every break,7
despite the fact that she was despised by everyone,13
and she went for some cheap money from a book,11
Numerous others also,7
While Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement,25
she is a very good person and I don’t think there would ever be reason to use it,23
She called me yesterday to apologize,11
had a bad night,4
I fully understood and forgave her,10
I love Tiffany,5

"The Euro is dropping against the Dollar “like crazy,” giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage...and the Fed does NOTHING",36

Makes no sense not to prosecute him,9
Comey got a book deal,6
I fear for my Country,6
He tried to kneecap our duly elected president,15
and there are no consequences.” @fox&amp;Fs,13
The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is,42
So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course,27
Comey got Lucky,5
The disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows,12
in the strongest of terms,6
how unfairly I,5
and tens of millions of great people who support me,13
were treated,3

The totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence O’Donnell,17
for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize,15
is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible,10
corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years,28
So bad for the USA,7
Crazy Lawrence O’Donnell,7
who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for the Presidency,23
even being previously forced by NBC to apologize,18
which he did while crying,6
for things he said about me &amp; The Apprentice,13
was again forced to apologize,9
this time....,2
for the most ridiculous claim of all,10
that Russia,3
Russia,2

or Russian oligarchs,6
co-signed loan documents for me,8
a guarantee,4
Totally false,4

Hurricane Dorian looks like it will be hitting Florida late Sunday night,20

I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News,30
The Amazon Washington Post and @CNN just did a Fake Interview on Pardons for Aids on the Wall,28

Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly),42
I would give them a Pardon,7

Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth,15

No good!...,2
And by the way,4
I’m the best thing that’s ever happened to Puerto Rico,16
Our Federal Reserve cannot “mentally” keep up with the competition - other countries,24
At the G-7 in France,7

The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down,15

spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor,17
@SandraSmithFox,5
Terrible considering that Fox couldn’t even land a debate,18
the Dems give them NOTHING,6

Too Bad!...,2
Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn,11
the leader of Britain’s Labour Party,11
to seek a no-confidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson,19

as usual,4

So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China,27

This has never happened to them before,10
“The infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times office” @OANN was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens,31

what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said,18
“why don’t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane,13
that should do it!” The media in our Country is totally out of control,21
They do stories so big on Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren’s crowd sizes,21

Starting on October 1st,8
the 250 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China,19
currently being taxed at 25%,12
will be taxed at 30%..,8
Additionally,5
the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China,19

The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States,20
year after year,4
for decades,3
will and must STOP,4
Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China,33
including bringing.,5
your companies HOME and making your products in the USA,16
I will be responding to China’s Tariffs this afternoon,16
This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States,15

I am ordering all carriers,9

"to SEARCH FOR &amp; REFUSE,...",7
Our Country has lost,6
stupidly,3
Trillions of Dollars with China over many years,13
They have stolen our Intellectual Property at a rate of Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year,28
&amp; they want to continue,8
I won’t let that happen,7
We don’t need China and,7
frankly,2
would be far...,3
As usual,4
the Fed did NOTHING,5
It is incredible that they can “speak” without knowing or asking what I am doing,22
which will be announced shortly,7
We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed,14
I will work “brilliantly” with both,8
and the U.S,4
will do great..,3
My only question is,6
who is our bigger enemy,9
Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?,7

The Economy is strong and good,9
whereas the rest of the world is not doing so well,13
Despite this the Fake News Media,9
together with their Partner,7
the Democrat Party,6
are working overtime to convince people that we are in,15
or will soon be going into,8
a Recession,4
They are....,2
willing to lose their wealth,6
or a big part of it,6
just for the possibility of winning the Election,15
But it won’t work because I always find a way to win,15

The Federal Reserve can easily make it Record Setting,16
The question is being asked,7
why are we paying much more in interest than Germany and certain other countries? Be early (for a change),28
not late,2
Let America win big,7
rather than just win,5
Germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields,15
Germany competes with the USA,10
Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do,18
They put us at a disadvantage against our competition,17

@LouDobbs interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M,20
@FoxNews,3
that when this Administration’s alternative is no longer available,21
California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin,15
Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative,30
which is much better for consumers,9
Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car,32
that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well,12
because execs don’t want to fight California regulators,17
Car companies should know...,6
The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P,12
Sloan,1
the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors,16
are “rolling over” at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good,37
and cost $3000 more to consumers,12
Crazy,2
“Tax cuts,2
deregulation,5
and an Administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the U.S,22
economy to flourish,7
The resulting surge in job creation and record low unemployment has put the American worker in the driver’s seat.“ @SecretaryRoss https://t.co/nN2bhDycq5,57
@NATO,3
very unfair to the United States,10
https://t.co/YIgmTkpScU,15
Because of me,4
these countries have agreed to pay ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS more - but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided,41
Sorry,2
For the record,4
Denmark is only at 1.35% of GDP for NATO spending,21
They are a wealthy country and should be at 2%,14
We protect Europe and yet,7
only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark,19
The United States is at a much,9
much higher level than that...,7

So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money,26
while the U.S.,4
a far stronger and more important credit,11
is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening,18
Strongest Dollar in History,8
very tough on exports,6
No Inflation!....,4
WHERE IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE?,8
My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000,43
while at the same time making the cars substantially safer,15
Engines would run smoother,6
Very little impact on the environment,12
Foolish executives,6
Doing great with China and other Trade Deals,11
The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed,14
He’s like a golfer who can’t putt,10
has no touch,3
Big U.S,3
growth if he does the right thing,7
BIG CUT - but don’t count on him,8
So far he has called it wrong,7
and only let us down...,6
We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate,20
and we should be lower than them,8
Yesterday,3
“highest Dollar in U.S.History.” No inflation,14
Wake up Federal Reserve,7
Such growth potential,5
almost like never before,7
The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the “create” a U.S,23
recession,3

not just America,6
he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him...,31
like he’s the King of Israel,9
They love him like he is the second coming of God...But American Jews don’t know him or like him,26
They don’t even know what they’re doing or saying anymore,17
It makes no sense,4

Our Economy is very strong,10
despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed,17

Very Selfish,4
Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world..,20
The Fed Rate,3
over a fairly short period of time,11
should be reduced by at least 100 basis points,13
with perhaps some quantitative easing as well,12
If that happened,4
our Economy would be even better,12

a complete setup,5
The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother,13
She doesn’t have to see her now,9
Israel was very respectful &amp; nice to Rep,14
Rashida Tlaib,4

Great interview of Ron Vitiello,10

by @JesseBWatters,6
on @FoxNews,4
about all of the work that is being (&amp; has been) done on our Southern Border,22
Thanks Ron,2
terrific job,4
Now if only the Democrats would fix the Loopholes &amp; Asylum,18
Great day in the incredible Commonwealth of Pennsylvania today,18
with the amazing energy workers,10
construction workers,5
and craft workers who make America run – and who make America PROUD,19
No one in the world does it better than YOU,11

No debate on Election Security should go forward without first agreeing that Voter ID (Identification) must play a very strong part in any final agreement,46
Without Voter ID,5
it is all so meaningless,7
Thank you Bill,3

True,1
Without being stuck at an airport,9
where CNN buys (at a big price) an uninterested audience,17
they’ve got nothing going,7
@CNN is BAD for America,11
https://t.co/68pehXFHmx,18
It always happens,5
When a Conservative does even a fraction of what Chris Cuomo did with his lunatic ranting,25
raving,2
&amp; cursing,4
they get destroyed by the Fake News,8
But when a Liberal Democrat like Chris Cuomo does it,15
Republicans immediately come to his defense,14
We never learn,4
See you in New Hampshire,6

Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong,28
Everyone should be calm and safe,8
Many are blaming me,6
and the United States,6
for the problems going on in Hong Kong,10
I can’t imagine why?,7
ALL THE NEWS THAT’S NOT FIT TO PRINT,9
“The New York Times is no longer the paper we grew up with,15
It is no longer a news organization,12
It is now an agenda driven organization out to change the Country (for the worse!).” Michael Goodwin,27
Highly Respected New York Post Columnist,11
As usual,4
China said they were going to be buying “big” from our great American Farmers,22
So far they have not done what they said,9
Maybe this will be different,8
Would Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control,27
He shouldn’t be allowed to have any weapon,13
He’s nuts,3
Thank you Steve,3
https://t.co/4qwvkUTg5t,18
Through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system,26
the tens of billions of dollars that the U.S,12
is receiving is a gift from China,10
Prices not up,4
no inflation,4
Farmers getting more than China would be spending,12
Fake News won’t report,6

Scaramucci,4
who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory,20
is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be),30
Also,2
I seldom had time to return his many calls to me,14
He just wanted to be on TV,9
Thank you NEGOP,4

Many incredible things are happening right now for our Country,18
After years of being ripped off by other nations on both Trade Deals and the Military,23
things are changing fast,5
Big progress is being made,7
America is respected again,10
KEEP AMERICA GREAT,6
So funny to watch Little Donny Deutsch on TV with his own failing show,19
When I did The Apprentice,7
Donny would call me (along with @ErinBurnett &amp; others) and BEG to be on that VERY successful show,29
He had the TV “bug” &amp; I would let him come on though he (&amp; Erin) had very little.,25
TV talent,4
Then,1
during the 2016 Election,12
I would watch as Joe Scarborough &amp; his very angry Psycho wife(?) would push Donny to the point of total humiliation,33
He would never fight back because he wanted to stay on TV,16
even on a very low rated show,10
all in the name of ambition,8
Anthony Scaramucci,7
who was quickly terminated (11 days) from a position that he was totally incapable of handling,30
now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on “President Trump.” Like many other so-called television experts,35
he knows very little about me....,9
other than the fact that this Administration has probably done more than any other Administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence,40
Anthony,3
who would do anything to come back in,10
should remember the only reason he is on TV,14
and it’s not for being the Mooch,9
Joe Biden just said,5
“We believe in facts,5
not truth.” Does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? We are “playing” in a very big and complicated world,37
Joe doesn’t have a clue,7
Think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show,16
to so many,4
how totally dishonest the Fake News Media really is,16
It may be the most corrupt and disgusting business (almost) there is,17
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
China wants to make a deal so badly,10
Thousands of companies are leaving because of the Tariffs,15
they must stem the flow,5
At the same time China may be hoping for a Democrat to win so they could continue the great ripoff of America,32
&amp; the theft of hundreds of Billions of $’s,14
Got to see,3
by accident,4
wacko comedian Bill Maher’s show - So many lies,14
He said patients in El Paso hospital didn’t want to meet with me,19
Wrong,1
Had really great meetings with numerous patients,12
Said I was on vacation,7
Wrong,1
Long planned fix up of W.H.,9
stay here rather than.,5
cause big disruption by going to Manhattan,12
Working almost all of the time,8
including evenings,5
Don’t have to be in W.H,10
to do that...And sooo many other false statements,12
He is right about one thing,7
though,1
I will win again in 2020,12
Otherwise,3
he pays 95% in taxes,10
Never has the press been more inaccurate,11
unfair or corrupt,5
We are not fighting the Democrats,9
they are easy,4
we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged Lamestream Media,20
They have gone totally CRAZY,8
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
In a letter to me sent by Kim Jong Un,11
he stated,3
very nicely,4
that he would like to meet and start negotiations as soon as the joint U.S./South Korea joint exercise are over,32
It was a long letter,6
much of it complaining about the ridiculous and expensive exercises,21
It was....,2
also a small apology for testing the short range missiles,16
and that this testing would stop when the exercises end,14
I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un in the not too distant future,18
A nuclear free North Korea will lead to one of the most successful countries in the world,24
Maggie Haberman of the Failing @nytimes reported that I was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in Dayton &amp; El Paso,41
when in fact I was the one who stated,10
very strongly,4
that I didn’t want the Fake News inside &amp; told my people NOT to let them in,22
Fake reporting,4
Liberal Hollywood is Racist at the highest level,15
and with great Anger and Hate,7
"They like to call themselves “Elite,” but they are not Elite",14
In fact,2
it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the Elite,23
The movie coming out is made in order...,11
to inflame and cause chaos,7
They create their own violence,8
and then try to blame others,7
They are the true Racists,6
and are very bad for our Country,10
Serious discussions are taking place between House and Senate leadership on meaningful Background Checks,26
I have also been speaking to the NRA,10
and others,3
so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected,19
Guns should not be placed in the hands of....,9
mentally ill or deranged people,9
I am the biggest Second Amendment person there is,14
but we all must work together for the good and safety of our Country,19
Common sense things can be done that are good for everyone,14
Rod Blagojevich,5
the former Governor of Illinois,10
was sentenced to 14 years in prison,10
He has served 7 years,6
Many people have asked that I study the possibility of commuting his sentence in that it was a very severe one,33
White House staff is continuing the review of this matter,15
I am pleased to inform you that the Honorable Joseph Maguire,17
current Director of the National Counterterrorism Center,18
will be named Acting Director of National Intelligence,16
effective August 15th,9
Admiral Maguire has a long and distinguished...,12
career in the military,8
retiring from the U.S,7
Navy in 2010,8
He commanded at every level,10
including the Naval Special Warfare Command,12
He has also served as a National Security Fellow at Harvard University,24
I have no doubt he will do a great job,10
Sue Gordon is a great professional with a long and distinguished career,19
I have gotten to know Sue over the past 2 years and have developed great respect for her,23
Sue has announced she will be leaving on August 15,14
which...,1
coincides with the retirement of Dan Coats,12
A new Acting Director of National Intelligence will be named shortly,20
I know Emmanuel means well,8
as do all others,5
but nobody speaks for the United States but the United States itself,19
No one is authorized in any way,10
shape,1
or form,2
to represent us,5
Iran is in serious financial trouble,12
They want desperately to talk to the U.S.,12
but are given mixed signals from all of those purporting to represent us,19
including President Macron of France...,10
John Deere,2
our car companies,6
&amp; others,4
to compete on a level playing field,10
With substantial Fed Cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening,21
the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition,25
We have the greatest companies..,8
in the world,3
there is nobody even close,8
but unfortunately the same cannot be said about our Federal Reserve,21
They have called it wrong at every step of the way,13
and we are still winning,6
Can you imagine what would happen if they actually called it right?,18
As your President,5
one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar,16
I am not,3
The Fed’s high interest rate level,10
in comparison to other countries,10
is keeping the dollar high,7
making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like Caterpillar,21
"Boeing,....",2
Just watched a world class loser,7
Tim O’Brien,4
who I haven’t seen or spoken to in many years,14
&amp; knows NOTHING about me except that he wrote a failed hit piece book about me 15 years ago,26
Fired like a dog from other jobs? Saw him on Lyin’ Brian Williams Trump Slam Show,21
Bad TV...,3
I am so amazed that MSNBC &amp; CNN can keep putting on,20
over and over again,7
people that have no idea what I am all about,14
and yet they speak as experts on “Trump.” Same people since long before the 2016 Election,26
and how did that work out for the Haters and Losers,13
Not well,2

What GREAT people I met there and in Dayton,11
Ohio,3
The Fake News worked overtime trying to disparage me and the two trips,18

They have been through so much,6
Sad,1
I don’t know who Joaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth,47
Joaquin is not the man that his brother is,11
but his brother,4
according to most,5
is not much,3
Keep fighting Joaquin,5

Actually,4
whenever possible,6
I turn to @OANN,5
misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital,15

Watching Sleepy Joe Biden making a speech,11
Sooo Boring,3
The LameStream Media will die in the ratings and clicks with this guy,17

We will WIN anyway,6
but it would be much easier if the Fed understood,14
which they don’t,4
that we are competing against other countries,12
all of whom want to do well at our expense,12
proud to admit their mistake of acting too fast and tightening too much (and that I was right!),23
They must Cut Rates bigger and faster,9
and stop their ridiculous quantitative tightening NOW,15
Yield curve is at too wide a margin,9
and no inflation,5
Incompetence is a....,6
“Three more Central Banks cut rates.” Our problem is not China - We are stronger than ever,22
money is pouring into the U.S,10

Over the past many decades,8
the U.S,3
has been paid very little by South Korea,12
but last year,3
at the request of President Trump,9
Talks have begun to further increase payments to the United States,17

China is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of Billions of Dollars they have been taking from the U.S,31
with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation,16
So one-sided,4
it should have been stopped many years ago,10
Based on the historic currency manipulation by China,17
it is now even more obvious to everyone that Americans are not paying for the Tariffs – they are being paid for compliments of China,38
and the U.S,4
is taking in tens of Billions of Dollars,11
China has always...,5
used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories,20
hurt our jobs,4
depress our workers’ wages and harm our farmers’ prices,16
Not anymore,4
China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low,19
It’s called “currency manipulation.” Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time,41
The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country,23

and he does not want to disappoint his friend,11
President Trump,4
Kim Jong Un and North Korea tested 3 short range missiles over the last number of days,23
These missiles tests are not a violation of our signed Singapore agreement,21
nor was there discussion of short range missiles when we shook hands,15
There may be a United Nations violation,13
but.,1
Chairman Kim does not want to disappoint me with a violation of trust,19
there is far too much for North Korea to gain - the potential as a Country,20
under Kim Jong Un’s leadership,9
is unlimited,5
Also,2
there is far too much to lose,7
I may be wrong,4
but I believe that.....,5
Really bad news,4
The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed,13
Too bad,2

and feel that the future between our two countries will be a very bright one,20
buy agricultural product from the U.S,12
in large quantities,5
but did not do so,5
Additionally,5
my friend President Xi said that he would stop the sale of Fentanyl to the United States – this never happened,28

Trade talks are continuing,7
and..,1
during the talks the U.S,7
will start,2
on September 1st,6
putting a small additional Tariff of 10% on the remaining 300 Billion Dollars of goods and products coming from China into our Country,42
This does not include the 250 Billion Dollars already Tariffed at 25%..,27
Our representatives have just returned from China where they had constructive talks having to do with a future Trade Deal,31
We thought we had a deal with China three months ago,13

More recently,4

Iran &amp; other foreign countries are looking at the Democrat Candidates and “drooling” over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future,46

Congratulations to Kelly Knight Craft of #Kentucky on her confirmation as United Nations Ambassador,32

It will soon be time to choose to keep and build upon that prosperity and success,21

A federal Judge in the Southern District of N.Y,14
completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee against our historic 2016 campaign for President,40

yet another total &amp; complete...,10
vindication &amp; exoneration from the Russian,15

they helped get me elected,7
Thanks,1
Was on all the time,5
Lost all of its juice,5
to ripoff the USA,7
even bigger and better than ever before,12
The problem with them waiting,7
however,3
is that if &amp; when I win,8
the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all,25
We have all the cards,5
our past leaders never got it,9
My team is negotiating with them now,11
but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit,15
They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe,28
Then they could make a GREAT deal,7
like in past 30 years,6
and continue,4
China is doing very badly,9
worst year in 27 - was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now - no signs that they are doing so,32
That is the problem with China,8
they just don’t come through,6
Our Economy has become MUCH larger than the Chinese Economy is last 3 years...,24
Despite the Democrats wanting very unsafe Open Borders &amp; refusing to change the Loopholes &amp; Asylum,31
tremendous progress is being made the the Southern Border,15
We all waited because we assumed the Dems would ultimately be forced to change the horrible Immigration Laws.They didn’t,33

Looking forward to my meeting at 2:00 P.M,14
with wonderful Inner City Pastors,10
The Fed “raised” way too early and way too much,11
Their quantitative tightening was another big mistake,15
While our Country is doing very well,11
the potential wealth creation that was missed,11
especially when measured against our debt,11
is staggering,4
We are competing with other....,8
countries that know how to play the game against the U.S,14
That’s actually why the E.U,10
was formed....and for China,6
until now,3
the U.S,3
has been “easy pickens.” The Fed has made all of the wrong moves,15
A small rate cut is not enough,8
but we will win anyway,7
even to new heights of success and glory,11
but not with King Elijah and that crew,10
When the leaders of Baltimore want to see the City rise again,17
I am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call,19
Crazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY,25
Based on that statement,5
I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist,14
just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard,16
The fact is,3
Baltimore can be brought back,7
maybe.....,2
The E.U,3
and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems,21
making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product,18
In the meantime,4
and with very low inflation,8
our Fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison,21
Too bad,2
Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events,14
He would say,3
“it’s a personal favor to me.” Seldom,12
but sometimes,3
I would go,3
It was fine,3
He came to my office in T.T,9
during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me,24
Just a conman at work,6
If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left “Squad” and King Elijah’s Baltimore Fail,27
it will be a long road to 2020,13
The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket,20
Baltimore,3
under the leadership of Elijah Cummings,12
has the worst Crime Statistics in the Nation,11
25 years of all talk,7
no action,3
So tired of listening to the same old Bull...Next,13

If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district,28
and Baltimore itself,6
perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership,32
His radical “oversight” is a joke,10
There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know,19
that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district,21
and of Baltimore itself,7
Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts,17
Shame,1
“Elijah Cummings has had his chance to address it (crime &amp; conditions in Baltimore) for decades,26
and he hasn’t gotten it done.” @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends How can he get it done when he just wants to use his Oversight Committee to hurt innocent people and divide our Country,50
Speaking of failing badly,7
has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosi’s district in San Francisco,24
It is not even recognizeable lately,12
Something must be done before it is too late,11
The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country,22
Someone please explain to Nancy Pelosi,11
who was recently called racist by those in her own party,15
that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that Congressman Elijah Cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the City of Baltimore,45
Just take..,2
a look,2
the facts speak far louder than words,8
The Democrats always play the Race Card,10
when in fact they have done so little for our Nation’s great African American people,25
Now,1
lowest unemployment in U.S,9

Elijah Cummings has failed badly,9

So sad that Elijah Cummings has been able to do so little for the people of Baltimore,25

but many other great “exonerating” things came out....,14
Robert Mueller’s testimony,9
and the Mueller Report itself,8

Nothing will ever be good enough for them,11

“Supreme Court approves Trump Administration plan to use Military Funds for the Wall.” @FoxNews We will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure,39
over time,3
by other countries,5
The Dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible Mueller performance,19
and are starting to spin impeachment all over again,14
How sick &amp; disgusting and bad for our Country are they,16
What they are doing is so wrong,8
but they do it anyway,7
Dems have become the do nothing Party,10
The Democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly &amp; irrevocably tarnished Witch Hunt Hoax until Robert Mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude &amp; incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen,62
Truth is,2
he had no facts on his side,7
Nothing he could do,5
Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA,17
the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats,30
a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 &amp; others),21
Would make it easier for police to do their job,13
Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States,39
No human being would want to live there,10
Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately,26
Rep,1
Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully,12
shouting and screaming at the great men &amp; women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border,29
when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous,19
His district is considered the Worst in the USA.....,14
As proven last week during a Congressional tour,13
the Border is clean,5
efficient &amp; well run,7
just very crowded,5
Cumming District is a disgusting,9
rat and rodent infested mess,8
If he spent more time in Baltimore,9
maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous &amp; filthy place,18

I would like to thank the Democrats for holding this morning’s hearing,18
Now,1
after 3 hours,5
Robert Mueller has to subject himself to #ShiftySchiff - an Embarrassment to our Country,26
“Mueller was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way,22

there was NO OBSTRUCTION,6

So why didn’t the highly conflicted Robert Mueller investigate how and why Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted and acid washed 33000 Emails immediately AFTER getting a SUBPOENA from the United States Congress? She must have GREAT lawyers,70
Why didn’t Robert Mueller &amp; his band of 18 Angry Democrats spend any time investigating Crooked Hillary Clinton,36

Lisa Page and her Psycho lover,9
Peter S,3
Andy McCabe,4
the beautiful Ohr family,8
Fusion GPS,5
and many more,4
including HIMSELF &amp; Andrew W?,12
It was NEVER agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat Never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers,39
This was specifically NOT agreed to,10
and I would NEVER have agreed to it,10
The Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S,8
history,3
by far,2
So Democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime,17
try pinning it on a very innocent President,14
and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our Country,22
they call It Obstruction? Wrong,7
Why didn’t Robert Mueller investigate the investigators?,18
So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers,28
What’s this all about? His lawyer represented the “basement server guy” who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case,31
This should NOT be allowed,6
Rigged Witch Hunt,3
The young leaders here today (@TPUSA) are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation,31
It is a movement about reclaiming YOUR future,13
rebuilding YOUR Country,6

He was just forced out of the Democrat Presidential Primary because he polled at ZERO,24
Fox sure ain’t what it used to be,9
Too bad,2
Just got back only to hear of a last minute change allowing a Never Trumper attorney to help Robert Mueller with his testimony before Congress tomorrow,43
What a disgrace to our system,9
Never heard of this before,7
VERY UNFAIR,4

I got to know him over his many years as Chairman of the Police Athletic League,22
for which he devoted so much time and energy,13
Bob Morgenthau,4

will be greatly missed,5
Leaving for Turning Point USA,9

that is crumbling and falling over,10

is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete Wall,16

When we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated Barrier on the Southern Border,30

I am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,25
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer,11
Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,10
and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - on a two-year Budget and Debt Ceiling,23
with no poison pills...,5
This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets,29
The “Squad” is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young,17
inexperienced,5
and not very smart,5
They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left,14
and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security,28
So bad for our Country,7
Going with First Lady to pay our respects to Justice Stevens,17
Leaving now,3
The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false,18
Zero truth,3
Just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a Religious Regime that is Badly Failing and has no idea what to do,37
Their Economy is dead,7
and will get much worse,5
Iran is a total mess,7
But the questions should be asked,7
why were all of Clinton’s people given immunity,15
and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover,16
Lisa Page,3
deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller,13
and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?,13
Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple,22
In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt,35
Result of the Mueller Report,8
NO COLLUSION,4
NO OBSTRUCTION!..,4
Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People,12
The Mainstream Media is out of control,11
They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see,27
It has never been this bad,7
They have gone bonkers,5
&amp; no longer care what is right or wrong,11
This large scale false reporting is sick,9
The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News,20
They said “Advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.” Now really,32
does that sound like me? What advisors,9
"there were no talking points,...",6
except for those stated by me,8
&amp; “reams of paper” were never given to me,13
It is a made up story meant to demean &amp; belittle,16
The Post had no sources,6
The facts remain the same,6
that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel &amp; our Country,30
It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does,28
in the future,4
turn down,2
Very inexpensive,6
in fact productive,5
to move now,3
The Fed raised &amp; tightened far too much &amp; too fast,14
In other words,4
they missed it (Big!),4
Don’t miss it again,6
as we have done,4
it could have been soooo much better,9
Interest rate costs should have been much lower,11
&amp; GDP &amp; our Country’s wealth accumulation much higher,21
Such a waste of time &amp; money,9
Also,2
very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in,22
With almost no inflation,7
our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve,42
In addition,4
Quantitative Tightening is continuing,12
making it harder for our Country to compete,13
As good....,2

Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators,25
This is a GREAT thing,5
Nearby,2
he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally,25
They wildly rushed Border Patrol,8
Some Agents were badly injured...,8
Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer,12
he must have seen how dangerous &amp; bad for our Country the Border is,20
"It is not a “manufactured crisis,” as the Fake News Media &amp; their Democrat partners tried to portray",29
He said he wants to meet,6
I will set up a meeting ASAP,11
Most importantly you have led Israel with a commitment to the values of democracy,25
freedom,2
and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share,18
Congratulations to Bibi @Netanyahu on becoming the longest serving PM in the history of Israel,33
Under your leadership,6
Israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy...,22
I don’t believe the four Congresswomen are capable of loving our Country,22
They should apologize to America (and Israel) for the horrible (hateful) things they have said,26
They are destroying the Democrat Party,11
but are weak &amp; insecure people who can never destroy our great Nation,21
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
Presidential Harassment,7
The Washington Post Story,7
about my speech in North Carolina and tweet,12
with its phony sources who do not exist,11
is Fake News,3
The only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm,28
far greater than the Democrats,8
You’ll see in 2020,10
Big progress at the Border,7
but Dems in Congress must change the Immigration Laws for all to be good,18
End the Loopholes and much more,7
The Great State of West Virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well,24
When I became President,7
it was practically shut down and closed for business,13

Fed: There is almost no inflation,9
I like New York Fed President John Williams first statement much better than his second,21

We are in a World competition,9

which would greatly reduce % debt,9
Don’t blow it,4

this was the first time since 1984 that the Speaker of the House was ruled Out of Order and broke the Rules of the House,36
Quite a day,3
So great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today’s vote concerning statements I made about four Democrat Congresswomen,38
If you really want to see statements,9
look at the horrible things they said about our Country,15
Israel,3
and much more,3
They are now the top,5

Kevin McCarthy @GOPLeader,9
“The President’s Tweets were not Racist,10
The controversy over the tweets is ALL POLITICS,14
I will vote against this resolution.” Thank you Kevin,14
Those Tweets were NOT Racist,6
I don’t have a Racist bone in my body,12
The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game,15
Republicans should not show “weakness” and fall into their trap,15
This should be a vote on the filthy language,11
statements and lies told by the Democrat....,10
Congresswomen,4
who I truly believe,6
based on their actions,5
hate our Country,5
Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said,12
Omar is polling at 8%,9
Cortez at 21%,8
Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away,11
but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party,16
See you in 2020,9
Our Country is Free,6
Beautiful and Very Successful,9
If you hate our Country,7
or if you are not happy here,8
you can leave,3
If you come after the President,9

“Billionaire Tech Investor Peter Thiel believes Google should be investigated for treason,24
He accuses Google of working with the Chinese Government.” @foxandfriends A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone,37
The Trump Administration will take a look,11
The Democrat Congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile,17
hateful,2
and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate,20
&amp; yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party,20
Horrible anti-Israel,8
anti-USA,5
pro-terrorist &amp; public....,8
shouting of the F...word,6
among many other terrible things,10
and the petrified Dems run for the hills,10
Why isn’t the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left,30
and the Democrats are afraid to take them on,12
Sad,1
“The best economy in our lifetime!” @IngrahamAngle,17
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
The Obama Administration built the Cages,13

DEMOCRATS MUST GIVE US THE VOTES TO CHANGE BAD IMMIGRATION LAWS,16
"The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four “progressives,” but now they are forced to embrace them",25
That means they are endorsing Socialism,11
hate of Israel and the USA,10
Not good for the Democrats,7
They are anti-Israel,7
pro Al-Qaeda,4
and comment on the 9/11 attack,12
“some people did something.” Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders,18
which means drugs,3
crime,1
human trafficking,5
and much more...,3
Detention facilities are not Concentration Camps,14
America has never been stronger than it is now – rebuilt Military,20
highest Stock Market EVER,7
lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before,17
Keep America Great,6
We will never be a Socialist or Communist Country,15
IF YOU ARE NOT HAPPY HERE,7
YOU CAN LEAVE,3
It is your choice,4

Here we go with the Fake Polls,7
Just like what happened with the Election against Crooked Hillary Clinton,19
ABC,3
NBC,3
CNN,3
@nytimes,3
@washingtonpost,5
they all got it wrong,5
on purpose,3
Suppression Polls so early? They will never learn,12
to impeach President Trump on DAY ONE,10
Make them the face of the future of the Democrat Party,15
you will destroy the Democrat Party,10
Their policies will destroy our Country!” @LindseyGrahamSC Need I say more?,20
“We all know that AOC and this crowd are a bunch of Communists,16
they hate Israel,5
they hate our own Country,7
they’re calling the guards along our Border (the Border Patrol Agents) Concentration Camp Guards,25
"they accuse people who support Israel as doing it for the Benjamin’s,...",21
they are Anti-Semitic,7
they are Anti-America,8
we don’t need to know anything about them personally,16
talk about their policies,7
I think they are American citizens who are duly elected that are running on an agenda that is disgusting,32
that the American people will reject.....,11
What does it mean for America to have free Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants,21
no criminalization of coming into our Country - See how that works for controlling Immigration,28
They talk about Israel like they’re a bunch of thugs,14
not victims of the entire region,10
They wanted..,3
If Democrats want to unite around the foul language &amp; racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular &amp; unrepresentative Congresswomen,47
it will be interesting to see how it plays out,13
I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S,19
When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country,20
the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President,19
for the foul language they have used,8
and the terrible things they have said,9
So many people are angry at them &amp; their horrible &amp; disgusting actions,23
with the U.S.,4
and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place,18
In the meantime,4
we are receiving Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China,16
with possibly much more to come,8
These Tariffs are paid for by China devaluing &amp; pumping,17
not by the U.S,5
taxpayer,3
China’s 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years,23
The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries,31
Thousands of companies are leaving,9
This is why China wants to make a deal...,10
We are doing great Economically as a Country,14
Number One,3
despite the Fed’s antiquated policy on rates and tightening,18
Much room to grow,4
and the many terrible things they say about the United States must not be allowed to go unchallenged,27
If the Democrat Party wants to continue to condone such disgraceful behavior,22
then we look even more forward to seeing you at the ballot box in 2020,24
So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who,26
in addition,4
hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion,13
Whenever confronted,6
they call their adversaries,7
including Nancy Pelosi,8
“RACIST.” Their disgusting language....,8

but we are getting it done anyway,10
https://t.co/w2fhJK6FmF,22
So interesting to see “Progressive” Democrat Congresswomen,17
who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe,25
the worst,2
most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all),26
now loudly.....,3
and viciously telling the people of the United States,15
the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth,12
how our government is to be run,10
Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came,26
Then come back and show us how...,7
it is done,3
These places need your help badly,8
you can’t leave fast enough,7
I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements,26

and fast,2
"But very happy with the deal I made,..",10
if Mexico produces (which I think they will),12
Biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed,15
China is similar,6
except they devalue currency &amp; subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% Tariffs,30
So far,2
little effect to consumers,8
Companies will relocate to U.S,10
When you are the big “piggy bank” that other countries have been ripping off for years (to a level that is not to be believed),31

I told @theresa_may how to do that deal,15
but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done,16
A disaster,4
I don’t know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool,19
Tell him the USA now has the best Economy &amp; Military anywhere in the World,26
by far..,2
and they are both only getting bigger,10
better and stronger.....Thank you,7
Mr,2
President,3
Very good numbers on the economy,11
Much potential for growth,6
Trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation,20
We have been treated very unfairly (to put it mildly) by other countries for many years,24
but that is changing,5
Spoke to @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy about the earthquakes in California and informed him that we will be working very closely on emergency funding,42
Also spoke to Governor @GavinNewsom - all working together,18
I have been very critical about the way the U.K,15
and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit,13
What a mess she and her representatives have created,15
I told her how it should be done,8
but she decided to go another way,11
I do not know the Ambassador,9
but he is not liked or well...,7
thought of within the U.S,7
We will no longer deal with him,8
The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister,25
While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent State Visit last month,17
it was the Queen who I was most impressed with,11
Brilliant Constitutional Lawyer,9
Dr,2
John Eastman,3
said the Special Prosecutor (Mueller) should have NEVER been appointed in the first place,22
The entire exercise was fundamentally illegal,16
The Witch Hunt should never happen to another President of the U.S,19
again,2
A TOTAL SCAM,4

A massive crowd that Fake News &amp; some Dems didn’t want to Report,18

https://t.co/ylJfs6hh9g,18
Impossible to believe that @FoxNews has hired @donnabrazile,19
the person fired by @CNN (after they tried to hide the bad facts,19
&amp; failed) for giving Crooked Hillary Clinton the questions to a debate,20
something unimaginable,8
Now she is all over Fox,7
including Shep Smith,5
by far...,2
their lowest rated show,6
Watch the @FoxNews weekend daytime anchors,11
who are terrible,5
go after her big time,6
That’s what they want - but it sure is not what the audience wants,16
Comcast (NBC/MSNBC) Trump haters,13
who do whatever Brian &amp; Steve tell them to do,14
Like CNN,4
NBC is also way down in the ratings,12
But @FoxNews,4
who failed in getting the very BORING Dem debates,13
is now loading up with Democrats &amp; even using Fake unsourced @nytimes as...,22
a “source” of information (ask the Times what they paid for the Boston Globe,18
&amp; what they sold it for (lost 1.5 Billion Dollars),15
or their old headquarters building disaster,11
or their unfunded liability? @FoxNews is changing fast,17
but they forgot the people who got them there,11
Watching @FoxNews weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings Fake News @CNN,23
or Lyin’ Brian Williams (remember when he totally fabricated a War Story trying to make himself into a hero,34
&amp; got fired,5
A very dishonest journalist!) and the crew of degenerate.....,17
We are building the Wall now,7
but the reason the badly needed Wall wasn’t approved in the Republican controlled House and Senate was that we had a very slim majority in the Senate,43
&amp; needed 9 Democrat votes,9
They were totally unwilling to give Wall votes to us,14
want Open Borders,5
United States Citizens first,8
Border Patrol,4
and others in Law Enforcement,8
have been doing a great job,7
We said there was a Crisis - the Fake News &amp; the Dems said it was “manufactured.” Now all agree we were right,28
but they always knew that,6
They are crowded (which we....,6
brought up,2
not them) because the Dems won’t change the Loopholes and Asylum,16
Big Media Con Job,6
The Fake News Media,6
in particular the Failing @nytimes,11
is writing phony and exaggerated accounts of the Border Detention Centers,22
First of all,3
people should not be entering our Country illegally,16
only for us to then have to care for them,11
We should be allowed to focus on ....,9
Congratulations to the U.S,9
Women’s Soccer Team on winning the World Cup,12
Great and exciting play,6
America is proud of you all,9
Last year was the first in 51 years where prescription drug prices actually went down,23
but things have been,4
and are being,4
put in place that will drive them down substantially,12
If Dems would work with us in a bipartisan fashion,14
we would get big results very fast,9
Sleepy Joe Biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately,22
has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone’s taxes if he becomes president,35
Ridiculously,5
all Democrats want to substantially raise taxes,13
Joe Biden is a reclamation project,11
Some things are just not salvageable,9
China and other countries that ripped us off for years are begging for him,18
He deserted our military,10
our law enforcement and our healthcare,11
Added more debt than all other Presidents combined,13
Won’t win,3

Our most difficult problem is not our competitors,16
it is the Federal Reserve,8
Strong jobs report,4
low inflation,4
and other countries around the world doing anything possible to take advantage of the United States,28
knowing that our Federal Reserve doesn’t have a clue,16
They raised rates too soon,5
too often,3
&amp; tightened,4
while others did just the opposite...,9
My deepest sympathies go out to the family and friends of great businessman and energy expert Chris Cline,28
his wonderful daughter,6

Amazing music and bands,7

Great news for the Republican Party as one of the dumbest &amp; most disloyal men in Congress is “quitting” the Party,32
No Collusion,4
No Obstruction,4

SALUTE TO AMERICA,7
an all day event at the Lincoln Memorial,13
culminating with large scale flyovers of the most modern....,15
and advanced aircraft anywhere in the World,11
Perhaps even Air Force One will do a low &amp; loud sprint over the crowd,19
That will start at 6:00P.M.,9
but be there early,5
Then,1
at 9:00 P.M.,6
a great (to put it mildly) fireworks display,11
I will speak on behalf of our great Country,12

HAPPY 4TH OF JULY,8
So important for our Country that the very simple and basic “Are you a Citizen of the United States?” question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census,48
Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this,22
even on the 4th of July,10
Today’s Stock Market is the highest in the history of our great Country,21
This is the 104th time since the Election of 2016 that we have reached a NEW HIGH,30
Congratulations USA,8
Iran has just issued a New Warning,10
Rouhani says that they will Enrich Uranium to “any amount we want” if there is no new Nuclear Deal,29
Be careful with the threats,6
Iran,2
They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before,17
Mexico is doing a far better job than the Democrats on the Border,20
Thank you Mexico,5
If Illegal Immigrants are unhappy with the conditions in the quickly built or refitted detentions centers,30
just tell them not to come,6
All problems solved,4
Now,1
if you really want to fix the Crisis at the Southern Border,16
both humanitarian and otherwise,11
tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally,24
and hopefully through a system based on Merit,12
This way we have no problems at all,9
Our Border Patrol people are not hospital workers,15
doctors or nurses,5
The Democrats bad Immigration Laws,10
which could be easily fixed,7
are the problem,4
Great job by Border Patrol,7
above and beyond,5
Many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they....,20
came from,2
and in far safer conditions,8
No matter how good things actually look,11
even if perfect,5
the Democrat visitors will act shocked &amp; aghast at how terrible things are,21
Just Pols,2
If they really want to fix them,8
change the Immigration Laws and Loopholes,10
So easy to do,5
The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or,35
to state it differently,6
FAKE,1
We are absolutely moving forward,10
as we must,3
because of the importance of the answer to this question,15
Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher,14
his wonderful wife Andrea,8
and his entire family,8
You have been through much together,8

We own the tanks and all,6
Fireworks are donated by two of the greats,11
Nice,1
China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA,37
We should MATCH,3
or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games - as they have for many years,36
S&amp;P 500 hits new record high,12
Up 19% for the year,8
Congratulations,5
We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world,15
We have the greatest military anywhere in the world,15
Not bad,2
Our July 4th Salute to America at the Lincoln Memorial is looking to be really big,30
It will be the show of a lifetime,9
Iran was violating the 150 Billion Dollar (plus 1.8 Billion Dollar in CASH) Nuclear Deal with the United States,38
and others who paid NOTHING,7
long before I became President - and they have now breached their stockpile limit,19
Not good,2
A very sad time for America when the Supreme Court of the United States won’t allow a question of “Is this person a Citizen of the United States?” to be asked on the #2020 Census,58
Going on for a long time,7
I have asked the Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice...,18
to do whatever is necessary to bring this most vital of questions,19
and this very important case,8
to a successful conclusion,8

“Salute to America.” The Pentagon &amp; our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this &amp; showing to the American people,41
among other things,5
the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World,17
Incredible Flyovers &amp; biggest ever Fireworks,15
The Economy is the BEST IT HAS EVER BEEN,13
Even much of the Fake News is giving me credit for that,15
As most people are aware,7
according to the Polls,6
I won EVERY debate,7
including the three with Crooked Hillary Clinton,13
despite the fact that in the first debate,10
they modulated the sound on me,9
and got caught,3
This crew looks somewhat easier than Crooked,11
but you never know?,5
People are fleeing New York like never before,12
If they own a business,6
they are twice as likely to flee,8
And if they are a victim of harassment by the A.G,15
of the state,3
like what they are doing to our great NRA,11
which I think will move quickly to Texas,10
where they are loved....,4
Texas will defend them &amp; indemnify them against political harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo,32
So many people are leaving New York for Texas and Florida that it is totally under siege,26
First New York taxes you too high,8
then they sue you,4
just to complete the job,6
Mark Levin has written a big number one bestselling book called,16
conspicuously and accurately,10
“Unfreedom of the Press.” It is a great book that tells it like it is,17
fake news and all,4
Keep this book number one,6
I will be interviewed by @TuckerCarlson tonight at 8:00pm on @FoxNews,24
In the meantime,4
our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems,25
No rush,2
but I am sure we will ultimately get there,12
It was great being with Chairman Kim Jong Un of North Korea this weekend,19
We had a great meeting,6
he looked really well and very healthy - I look forward to seeing him again soon...,21
I am excited to announce that @MercedesSchlapp will soon be joining our Campaign,22
She feels so strongly about our Country &amp; its future,16
We are setting records in so many ways,11
&amp; we will keep it going,8
Mercedes has done a fantastic job within the Administration &amp; I am so thankful,25
That’s right,3
The Trump Foundation gave away 100% plus,14
with Zero rent or expenses charged,9
and has been being sued by Cuomo and New York State for years - another part of the political Witch Hunt,27
Just in case anyone is interested - Clinton Foundation never even looked at,22
New York businesses in search of anything at all they can find to make me look as bad as possible,26
So,1
on top of ridiculously high taxes,11
my children and companies are spending a fortune on lawyers,16
No wonder people and businesses are fleeing New York in record numbers,19
It is very hard and expensive to live in New York,14
Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes,28
They sue on everything,6
always in search of a crime,7
I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent &amp; expenses &amp; gave away..,25
more money than it had,6
Going on for years,5
originally brought by Crooked Hillary’s Campaign Chair,16

The highly respected Farm Journal has just announced my Approval Rating with our great Farmers at 74%,32

I would meet him at the Border/DMZ just to shake his hand and say Hello(?),21

I would be at 75% (with our great economy,18
maybe the best ever) if not for the Phony Witch Hunt and the Fake News Media,21

representing our Country well,9
but I heard it was not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie,18
One is exhausted,5
the other is nuts - so what’s the big deal?,11
The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election,20
all the way up to the day that I took office,12
because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President,22
That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me,14
If Hillary won - a Big Crash,8
All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare,26
How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race,22

Seems totally ridiculous that our government,14
and indeed Country,5
cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive,20
detailed and important Census,8
in this case for 2020,10
I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census,14
no matter how long,5
until the....,3
United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter,42
Can anyone really believe that as a great Country,14

Does it ever end?,5
According to Fake News (and low ratings) @CNN,14
“Democrats say hearings could change impeachment debate.” That’s because they have lost the impeachment debate (80% say NO),32
and they are hoping that yet another DO OVER,13
after 2 1/2 years and $40000000,14
will turn things around...,5

It can be done instantly,7
Just departed for the #G20 Summit in Osaka,17

The Democrats should change the Loopholes and Asylum Laws so lives will be saved at our Southern Border,26
They said it was not a crisis at the Border,12
that it was all just “manufactured.” Now they admit that I was right - But they must do something about it,26
Fix the Laws NOW,4

Iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement,14
put out today,4
only shows that they do not understand reality,14
Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force,26
In some areas,5
overwhelming will mean obliteration,11
No more John Kerry &amp; Obama,10
"Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words “nice” or “compassion,” they never have",22
Sadly,2
the thing they do understand is Strength and Power,12
and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world,21
with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone.,19
The wonderful Iranian people are suffering,14
and for no reason at all,7
Their leadership spends all of its money on Terror,13

asking Hillary Clinton why she deleted and acid washed her Emails AFTER getting a subpoena from Congress? Anybody else would be in jail for that,41

Rigged House Committee,5
So sad that the Democrats are putting wonderful Hope Hicks through hell,17
for 3 years now,4
after total exoneration by Robert Mueller &amp; the Mueller Report,21
They were unhappy with result so they want a Do Over,15
Very unfair &amp; costly to her,10

If I didn’t have the Phony Witch Hunt going on for 3 years,17

DEMOCRAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ARE #RIGGED,13
33000 Emails that Hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS? That is real Obstruction that the Dems want no part of because their hearings are RIGGED and a disgrace to our Country,62
The Dems are very unhappy with the Mueller Report,14
so after almost 3 years,7
they want a Redo,5

European Markets rose on comments (unfair to U.S.) made today by Mario D,23
Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come,14
which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar,15

They have been getting away with this for years,11
along with China and others,8

The story in the @nytimes about the U.S,13

except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% Tariff,29
So far,2
little effect to consumer,8
Companies will relocate to U.S,10
Companies to come to the U.S.A and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home,28

When will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the the new Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported “hit job” on me,46
something that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency,21
Sick Journalism,5
We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico,35
one that the U.S,5
has been asking about getting for many years,12
It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexico’s Legislative body!.,29
We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but,14
if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming,15
Tariffs will be reinstated,8
Now with our new deal,6
Mexico is doing more for the USA on Illegal Immigration than the Democrats,25
In fact,2
the Democrats are doing NOTHING,9
"they want Open Borders,
which means Illigal Immigration",15
Drugs and Crime,3
The Failing @nytimes story on Mexico and Illegal Immigration through our Southern Border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue,39
bad reporting,4
and the paper is embarrassed by it,10
The only problem is that they knew it was Fake News before it went out,18
Corrupt Media,5
For two years all the Democrats talked about was the Mueller Report,17
because they knew that it was loaded up with 13 Angry Democrat Trump Haters,21
later increased to 18,7
But despite the bias,6
when the Report came out,6
the findings were No Collusion and facts that led to.......,13
No Obstruction,4
The Dems were devastated - after all this time and money spent ($40000000),22
the Mueller Report was a disaster for them,12
But they want a Redo,6
or Do Over,4
They are even bringing in @CNN sleazebag attorney John Dean,18
Sorry,2
no Do Overs - Go back to work,8
If President Obama made the deals that I have made,14
both at the Border and for the Economy,12
the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible,16
&amp; a National Holiday would be immediately declared,18
With me,2
despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done,18
no credit,3
Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform,18
without restriction,5
It’s called Freedom of Speech,7
remember,3
You are making a Giant Mistake,9
Another false report in the Failing @nytimes,13
We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time,18
as have other administrations,9
but were not able to get them,8
or get them in full,5
until our signed agreement with Mexico,12
Additionally,5
"and for many years,...",5
Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had,20
or didn’t have,5
and now I have full confidence,8
especially after speaking to their President yesterday,15
that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done,21
Importantly,4
some things....,2
not mentioned in yesterday press release,10
one in particular,6
were agreed upon,5
That will be announced at the appropriate time,12
There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico &amp; the USA,24
something that didn’t exist for decades,11
However,3
if for some unknown reason..,7
there is not,3
we can always go back to our previous,12
very profitable,6
position of Tariffs - But I don’t believe that will be necessary,19
The Failing @nytimes,6
&amp; ratings challenged @CNN,10
will do anything possible to see our Country fail,15
They are truly The Enemy of the People,12
I know it is not at all “Presidential” to hit back at the Corrupt Media,21
or people who work for the Corrupt Media,12
when they make false statements about me or the Trump Administration,17
Problem is,3
if you don’t hit back,6
people believe the Fake News is true,9
So we’ll hit back,5

If we are able to make the deal with Mexico,13
&amp; there is a good chance that we will,10
they will begin purchasing Farm &amp; Agricultural products at very high levels,23
starting immediately,7
If we are unable to make the deal,10

Today,2
we remember those who fell,7
and we honor all who fought,7
here in Normandy,5
They won back this ground for civilization,11
To more than 170 Veterans of the Second World War who join us today: You are among the very greatest Americans who will ever live,42
#DDay75thAnniversary https://t.co/n0uIVHlkRL,30
So sorry to hear about the terrible accident involving our GREAT West Point Cadets,24
We mourn the loss of life and pray for the injured,12

A big and beautiful day today,9
“The President has received glowing reviews from the British Media,18
Here at home,3
not so much,3
MSNBC Ramps up hateful coverage and promotes conspiracy theories during Trump’s trip to Europe.” @seanhannity The good news is that @maddow is dying in the ratings,48

Immigration discussions at the White House with representatives of Mexico have ended for the day,27
Progress is being made,6
but not nearly enough,6
Border arrests for May are at 133000 because of Mexico &amp; the Democrats in Congress refusing to budge on immigration reform,44
Further..,2
talks with Mexico will resume tomorrow with the understanding that,18
if no agreement is reached,7
Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday,15
with monthly increases as per schedule,10
The higher the Tariffs go,7
the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA,19
As we approach the 75th Anniversary of D-Day,19
we proudly commemorate those heroic and honorable patriots who gave their all for the cause of freedom during some of history’s darkest hours,41
#DDay75 https://t.co/hjTkdM7VcN,29
“House Republicans support the President on Tariffs with Mexico all the way,21
&amp; that makes any measure the President takes on the Border totally Veto proof,23
Why wouldn’t you as Republicans support him when that will allow our President to make a better deal.” Thank you @GOPLeader,35
If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt,14
I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy,26
maybe Best Ever,5
If the Corrupt Media was actually fair,13
I would be up by 25 points,9
Nevertheless,4
despite the Fake News,5
we’re doing great,5
House Democrats,4
fresh off a Republican victory against them (in Federal Court) on the Wall,21
keep asking people to come and testify regarding the No Collusion Witch Hunt,21
They are very unhappy with the Mueller Report,13
especially with his corrective letter,10
&amp; now want a Do Over,8
Could not have been treated more warmly in the United Kingdom by the Royal Family or the people,27
Our relationship has never been better,12
and I see a very big Trade Deal down the road,12
“This trip has been an incredible success for the President.” @IngrahamAngle,22
@FLOTUS Melania and I send our deepest condolences to President Reuven Rivlin and the entire State of Israel upon the passing of Mrs,44
Nechama Rivlin,5
Mrs,2
Rivlin represented her beloved country with grace and stature,16
We will miss her along with all those who knew her,12
If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt,14
I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy,26
maybe Best Ever,5
If the Corrup Media was actually fair,13
I would be up by 25 points,9
Nevertheless,4
despite the Fake News,5
we’re doing great,5
I kept hearing that there would be “massive” rallies against me in the UK,18
but it was quite the opposite,8
The big crowds,3
which the Corrupt Media hates to show,10
were those that gathered in support of the USA and me,15
They were big &amp; enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops,19
Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem,27
but the Corrupt Media will save him,10
His other problem is that he is drawing flies,12
not people,3
to his Rallies,4
Nobody is showing up,7
I mean nobody,5
You can’t win without people,8

Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make “your great president” look really bad,55
She got caught,3
just like the Fake News Media gets caught,10
A sick scammer,4
Can you imagine Cryin’ Chuck Schumer saying out loud,14
for all to hear,4
that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico,17
What a Creep,3
He would rather have our Country fail with drugs &amp; Immigration than give Republicans a win,26
But he gave Mexico bad advice,9
no bluff,2
Just had a big victory in Federal Court over the Democrats in the House on the desperately needed Border Wall,32
A big step in the right direction,9
Wall is under construction,7

Great,1
now we will get it done in the Senate,10
Farmers,2
Puerto Rico and all will be very happy,12
As a sign of good faith,6
Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border,29
They can do it if they want,7
Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela,21
London part of trip is going really well,11
The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic,17
The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong,16
Tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our Country,17
Haven’t seen any protests yet,9
but I’m sure the...,5
Fake News will be working hard to find them,10
Great love all around,5
Also,2
big Trade Deal is possible once U.K,10
gets rid of the shackles,6
Already starting to talk,7
I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT,17
they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN,14
which is dying in the ratings anyway,11
It is so unfair with such bad,8
Fake News,2
Why wouldn’t they act,6
When the World watches @CNN,9
it gets a false picture of USA,10
Sad,1
Just arrived in the United Kingdom,10
The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S,27
After watching it for a short while,9
I turned it off,4
All negative &amp; so much Fake News,10
very bad for U.S,6
Big ratings drop,4
Why doesn’t owner @ATT do something?,11
China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA,27
Many firms are leaving China for other countries,13
including the United States,8
in order to avoid paying the Tariffs,11
No visible increase in costs or inflation,12
but U.S,3
is taking Billions,5
Thank you,2

Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC,22

who has also done a terrible job - only half his height,15
In any event,5
I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom,17
and am looking very much forward to my visit,13
Landing now,3
@SadiqKhan,4
who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London,18
has been foolishly “nasty” to the visiting President of the United States,21
by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom,16
He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London,16
not me.....,2
BIG NEWS,2
As I promised two weeks ago,8
the first shipment of LNG has just left the Cameron LNG Export Facility in Louisiana,26
Not only have thousands of JOBS been created in USA,16
we’re shipping freedom and opportunity abroad,14
Kevin Hassett,4
who has done such a great job for me and the Administration,16
will be leaving shortly,6
His very talented replacement will be named as soon as I get back to the U.S,22
I want to thank Kevin for all he has done - he is a true friend,16
Hearing word that Russia,6
Syria and,4
to a lesser extent,6
Iran,2
are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria,15
and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians,17
The World is watching this butchery,9
What is the purpose,5
what will it get you? STOP,6
Democrats can’t impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats,24
The facts are “pouring” in,6
The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History,13
Congress,2
go back to work and help us at the Border,11
with Drug Prices and on Infrastructure,10
Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border,19
Problem is,3
they’ve been “talking” for 25 years,10
We want action,4
not talk,2
They could solve the Border Crisis in one day if they so desired,17
Otherwise,3
our companies and jobs are coming back to the USA,16
Peggy Noonan,4
the simplistic writer for Trump Haters all,11
is stuck in the past glory of Reagan and has no idea what is happening with the Radical Left Democrats,30
or how vicious and desperate they are,9
Mueller had to correct his ridiculous statement,13
Peggy never understood it,8
I never called Meghan Markle “nasty.” Made up by the Fake News Media,19
and they got caught cold,5
Will @CNN,5
@nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it,12
NO COLLUSION,4
NO OBSTRUCTION,4
NO NOTHING,3
“What the Democrats are trying to do is the biggest sin in the impeachment business.” David Rivkin,26

the Dems are getting nothing done in Congress,11
They are frozen stiff,5
Get back to work,4
much to do,3
The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly,15
despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits,16
What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want,31
Make America Great Again,8
People have been saying for years that we should talk to Mexico,16
The problem is that Mexico is an “abuser” of the United States,19
taking but never giving,7
It has been this way for decades,8
Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers,17
Cartels,2
Human Traffickers...,5
Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants,10
which they can do very easily,9
or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border,25
will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs),17
America has had enough,8
The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis,33
Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes,21

When you are the “Piggy Bank” Nation that foreign countries have been robbing and deceiving for years,24
the word TARIFF is a beautiful word indeed,12
Others must treat the United States fairly and with respect - We are no longer the “fools” of the past,25
U.S,2
in order to avoid paying the 25% Tariff,16
Like Mexican companies will move back to the United States once the Tariff reaches the higher levels,27
They took many of our companies &amp; jobs,13
the foolish Pols let it happen,8
and now they will come back unless Mexico stops the....,13
travesty that is taking place in allowing millions of people to easily meander through their country and INVADE the U.S.,34
not to mention the Drugs &amp; Human Trafficking pouring in through Mexico,20
Are the Drug Lords,4
Cartels &amp; Coyotes really running Mexico? We will soon find out,19
Washington Post got it wrong,7
as usual,4
The U.S,3
is charging 25% against 250 Billion Dollars of goods shipped from China,26
not 200 BD,6
Also,2
China is paying a heavy cost in that they will subsidize goods to keep them coming,22
devalue their currency,7
yet companies are moving to....,8

John,1
Rest In Peace,3
90% of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico &amp; our Southern Border,29
80000 people died last year,9
1000000 people ruined,7
This has gone on for many years &amp; nothing has been done about it,18
We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico,18
It’s time,3
In order not to pay Tariffs,8
if they start rising,5
companies will leave Mexico,8
which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry,16
and come back home to the USA,9
Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels,16
The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals,15
Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades,18
Because of the Dems,5
our Immigration Laws are BAD,9
Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S.,11
have for decades,4
they can easily fix this problem,9
Time for them to finally do what must be done,12
Hard to believe that with the Crisis on the Border,13
the Dems won’t do the quick and easy fix,11
Would solve the problem but they want Open Borders,12
which equals crime,4

the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico,29

"the Fake News Media,....",6
say he fought back against this phony crime that didn’t exist,16
this horrendous false accusation,9
and he shouldn’t fight back,7
he should just sit back and take it,8

How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? WITCH-HUNT,28
Nothing changes from the Mueller Report,10
There was insufficient evidence and therefore,12

a person is innocent,7
The case is closed,4

Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama,27
This time it will be for Six Years,8

Can’t believe that Rolling Thunder would be given a hard time with permits in Washington,23
D.C,2
They are great Patriots who I have gotten to know and see in action,18
They love our Country and love our Flag,11
If I can help,4
I will,2
Democrat Senator Mark Warner is acting and talking like he is in total control of the Senate Intelligence Committee,34
Their is nothing bipartisan about him,11
He should not be allowed to take “command” of that Committee,15
Too important,4
Remember when he spoke to the Russian jokester?,12
The real trade war began 30 years ago,11
and we lost,3
This is a bright new Age,6
the Age of Enlightenment,7
We don’t lose anymore,7

In Alaska with our GREAT TROOPS,9
departing shortly for Japan,8
https://t.co/9a72TMftpN,25
The Dems want a second shot at Bob Mueller,11
are very unhappy with the No Collusion Report,14
They should not be allowed to play this game any longer - no second chances - must get back to work,24
So bad for our Country,7
(with many more to come) and 2 Supreme Court Justices - we are getting into record territory,26
Thank you all and have a great Memorial Day Weekend,14
Mitch McConnell and our Republican Senators have been very solid and strong,22
We have accomplished a great deal together,11
in particular with our Courts,9
107 Federal Judges...,11

Just spoke to Prime Minister @NarendraModi where I congratulated him on his big political victory,31
He is a great man and leader for the people of India - they are lucky to have him,23
Congratulations to Tom Cotton - his book,11
“Sacred Duty: A Solider’s Tour at Arlington National Cemetery” just hit the best sellers list,28
I was at @ArlingtonNatl yesterday &amp; the people there were so grateful for Tom’s inspiring portrait of “The Old Guard.” Great job @TomCottonAR,41
I don’t know why the Radical Left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 Million Dollar Report that states,37
loud &amp; clear &amp; for all to hear,10
No Collusion and No Obstruction (how do you Obstruct a NO crime?) Dems are just looking for trouble and a Do-Over,30
“If they try to Impeach President Trump,10
who has done nothing wrong (No Collusion),10
they will end up getting him re-elected” @LindseyGrahamSC Impeachment is for High Crimes and Misdemeanors,28
There were no High Crimes and Misdemeanors,10
except for those committed by the other side,12
“Intelligence Agencies were used against an American President.” @DevinNunes @ShannonBream @FoxNews This should NEVER happen to a President again,43
Dems are furious at Robert Mueller for his findings - NO COLLUSION,18
NO OBSTRUCTION,4
Now they should go back to work and legislate,11
When is Twitter going to allow the very popular Conservative Voices that it has so viciously shut down,30
back into the OPEN? IT IS TIME,9
Wow,1
CNN Ratings are WAY DOWN,8
record lows,3
People are getting tired of so many Fake Stories and Anti-Trump lies,19
Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television,38
Don Lemon,3

“Today,2
at the request and recommendation of the Attorney General of the United States,24
President Donald J,6
Trump directed the intelligence community to quickly and fully cooperate with the Attorney General’s investigation into surveillance activities...,46
during the 2016 Presidential election,16
The Attorney General has also been delegated full and complete authority to declassify information pertaining to this investigation,42
in accordance with the long-established standards for handling classified information...,22
Today’s action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred,26
and the actions that were taken,8
during the last Presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions.” @PressSec,30
@FoxNews Poll: A majority of Americans want the Democrats to stop investigating President Trump,30
The Mueller Report said very strongly NO COLLUSION,14
which led to NO OBSTRUCTION,7
The Dems can’t get over 2016 or the conclusive Mueller findings,22
They are now the Do Nothing Party,9
The U.S,3

When the Democrats in Congress refinish,11
for the 5th time,6
their Fake work on their very disappointing Mueller Report finding,17
they will have the time to get the REAL work of the people done,15
Move quickly,3
I was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with Pelosi and Schumer,20
knowing that they would say I was raging,10
which they always do,5
along with their partner,6
the Fake News Media,6
Well,1
so many stories about the meeting use the Rage narrative anyway - Fake &amp; Corrupt Press,25
Rex Tillerson,4
a man who is “dumb as a rock” and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State,27
made up a story (he got fired) that I was out-prepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg,28
Germany,3
I don’t think Putin would agree,9
Look how the U.S,5
is doing,3
The Democrats have become known as THE DO NOTHING PARTY,15
drug prices,3
pre-existing conditions and our great Vets,12
All they are geared up to do,7
six committees,4
is squander time,4
day after day,4
trying to find anything which will be bad for me,13
A pure fishing expedition like this never happened before,16
&amp; it should never happen again,10
The Democrats are getting nothing done in Congress,13
All of their effort is about a Re-Do of the Mueller Report,17
which didn’t turn out the way they wanted,11
It is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time,21
Their heart is not into Infrastructure,10
lower....,2
Democrats don’t want to fix the loopholes at the Border,15
They don’t want to do anything,9
Open Borders and crime,6
Zero is getting done with the Democrats in charge of the House,16
All they want to do is put the Mueller Report behind them and start all over again,22
No Do-Overs,4
In a letter to her House colleagues,9
Nancy Pelosi said: “President Trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.” This is not true,25
I was purposely very polite and calm,11
much as I was minutes later with the press in the Rose Garden,16
Can be easily proven,7
It is all such a lie,6
I want to welcome you all to the @WhiteHouse as we award our very bravest law enforcement officers and firefighters our nation’s highest public safety award – The Medal of Valor...https://t.co/68EeQk8ZHr,68
Democrat leadership is tearing the United States apart,16
but I will continue to set records for the American People – and Nancy,21
thank you so much for your prayers,7
I know you truly mean it,7
But they really want a do-over,9
You can’t investigate and legislate simultaneously - it just doesn’t work that way,25
You can’t go down two tracks at the same time,11
Let Chuck,2
Nancy,2
Jerry,2
Adam and all of the rest finish playing their games...,13
In the meantime,4
my Administration is achieving things that have never been done before,19
including unleashing perhaps the Greatest Economy in our Country’s history...,24
So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country,33
They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America,41
or get back to work...,5
https://t.co/Oe8E5kk8OA,22
As I have long been saying,7
and has now been proven out,7
this is a Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and myself,17
and it was the other side that caused the problem,12
not us,2
BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN,9
Mr,2
McGahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in Mr,21
"Nadler’s pseudo-impeachment drama.”
 
Wall Street Journal Editorial Board
Today - May 21",27
2019,6
“He (Jerry Nadler) wants a show,9
He wants to use Mr,6
McGahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that Mr,15
Trump tried to obstruct the Mueller investigation,13
YET MR,3
MUELLER WASN’T OBSTRUCTED IN ANY WAY,12
HIS COPIOUS REPORT WAS RELEASED FOR ALL TO SEE,13
&amp; THERE WAS NO COLLUSION.,8
“The Democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases,35
They ought to start governing,7
You know,2
for a change.” Michael Goodwin @newyorkpost,11
Everybody,4
including me,4
thought that when the 40 Million Dollar Mueller Report was released with No Collusion and No Obstruction (of a crime caused by others),34
that was the end,4
But no,2
the Democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020,24
Bad for the Country,5
Much of the Wall being built at the Southern Border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new Wall and footings,41
Problem is,3
the Haters say that is not a new Wall,10
but rather a renovation,8
Wrong,1
and we must build where most needed...,8
Also,2
tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective,32
and bringing them to a very high standard,11
Without the ILLEGAL Witch Hunt,8
my poll numbers,4
especially because of our historically “great” economy,18
would be at 65%,8
Too bad,2
The greatest Hoax in American History,12
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT,7
The Democrats are getting ZERO work done in Congress,14
All they are focused on is trying to prove the Mueller Report wrong,17
the Witch Hunt,3
After two years of an expensive and comprehensive Witch Hunt,16
the Democrats don’t like the result and they want a DO OVER,17
In other words,4
the Witch Hunt continues,6
Everything the Democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them,31
especially when the Mueller Report came back with a NO COLLUSION finding,19
Now they say Impeach President Trump,9
even though he did nothin wrong,8
while they “fish!”,3
Congratulations to Governor @MattBevin on winning the Republican Primary for Governor tonight in the Great State of KENTUCKY,38

Great news for Republicans: Fred Keller has just won the hard fought for Pennsylvania Congressional contest in a LANDSLIDE,31
over 70% of the vote,10
Thanks to the thousands who showed up for the Rally last night,14
Congratulations to Fred and his wonderful family,15
John Brennan on the Mueller probe,8
“I don’t know if I received bad information,13
but I THINK I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THERE ACTUALLY WAS.” Wow,19
he admits he was wrong,6
Congress should go back to work on drug prices etc,15
The Democrats are on a fishing expedition,13
wanting to interview the same people,10
and see the same things,5
as we just went through for two years with Robert Mueller and the 18 Angry Dems,20
Never happened to a president before,11
Never even happened to President Obama,13
After spending 40 Million Dollars,10
reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents,14
&amp; interviewing 500 people with the total support of the White House,21
the Mueller Report was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to the Democrats,17
so they want a DO OVER,7
It doesn’t work that way-so bad for our Country,14
Shahira Knight has done a wonderful job as my Legislative Affairs Director at the White House,26
She was outstanding for us and for our Country - will be a tremendous success in the private sector,27

So even though I didn’t have to do it with Presidential Privilege,20
I allowed everyone to testify,10
including White House Counsel Don McGahn (for over 30 hours),17
to Robert Mueller and the 18 Angry Trump-Hating Democrats,17
and they arrived...,4
at a conclusion of NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,15
The Dems were unhappy with the outcome of the $40M Mueller Report,21
so now they want a do-over,8
I am pleased to announce my nomination of Barbara Barrett of Arizona,22
and former Chairman of the Aerospace Corporation,14
to be the next Secretary of the Air Force,12
She will be an outstanding Secretary,11

Mexico’s attitude is that people from other countries,16
including Mexico,6
should have the right to flow into the U.S,11
&amp; that U.S,5
taxpayers should be responsible for the tremendous costs associated w/this illegal migration,31
Mexico is wrong and I will soon be giving a response,15
I am very disappointed that Mexico is doing virtually nothing to stop illegal immigrants from coming to our Southern Border where everyone knows that because of the Democrats,52
our Immigration Laws are totally flawed &amp; broken..,16
To the great people of Kentucky,9
please go out and vote for Matt Bevin today,11
Very important,5

The Fake News put out a typically false statement,12
without any knowledge that the United States was trying to set up a negotiation with Iran,27
This is a false report...,6
Iran will call us if and when they are ever ready,14
In the meantime,4
their economy continues to collapse - very sad for the Iranian people,22
On this Cuban Independence Day,9
we stand by the people of Cuba in their quest for freedom,15
democracy and prosperity,9
The Cuban regime must end its repression of Cubans &amp; Venezuelans,20
The United States will not stand idly by as Cuba continues to subvert democracy in the Americas,30
Looks like Bernie Sanders is history,10
Sleepy Joe Biden is pulling ahead and think about it,15
I’m only here because of Sleepy Joe and the man who took him off the 1% trash heap,24
President O,4
China wants Sleepy Joe BADLY,8
Why are the Democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation? They would get back their credibility,45
Jerry Nadler,5
Schiff,1
would have a whole new future open to them,11
Perhaps they could even run for President,11
“We have a booming economy,9
and working people are making gains that they haven’t seen in decades.” Stuart Varney @foxandfriends,26
Two Tweets missing from last batch,7
probably a Twitter error,8
No time for a redo,6
Only the Dems get redos,7
was very good and highly professional to deal with - and if for any reason I didn’t like them,27
I would have gone elsewhere....there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from,22
They would be very happy to take my money,12
Fake News,2
The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years),19
and others of the Fake News Media,10
keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me,31
WRONG,1
It is because I didn’t need money,11
Very old,3
fashioned,2
but true,2
When you don’t need or want money,9
you don’t need or want banks,7
Banks have always been available to me,11
they want to make money,6
Fake Media only says this to disparage,12
and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources don’t even exist).....,20
The Mainstream Media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today,21
FAKE NEWS is actually the biggest story of all and is the true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE,25
That’s why they refuse to cover the REAL Russia Hoax,14
But the American people are wise to what is going on....,16
Now the new big story is that Trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash,22
he doesn’t need banks,6
But where did he get all of that cash? Could it be Russia? No,15
I built a great business and don’t need banks,11
but if I did they would be there...and DeutscheBank.....,11
The Mainstream Media hates to cover this,11

Hard to believe that @FoxNews is wasting airtime on Mayor Pete,17
as Chris Wallace likes to call him,8
Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems,19
They got dumped from the Democrats boring debates,12
and they just want in,5
They forgot the people....,6
who got them there,4
Chris Wallace said,4
“I actually think,6
whether you like his opinions or not,10
that Mayor Pete has a lot of substance...fascinating biography.” Gee,19
he never speaks well of me - I like Mike Wallace better...and Alfred E,18

Watched some of the Fake News Political Shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way,38
The Mainstream Media should be ashamed of itself - But the good news is that the USA is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception,37
Never a fan of @justinamash,10
a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great Republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy,43
If he actually read the biased Mueller Report,14
"“composed” by 18 Angry Dems who hated Trump,...",12
he would see that it was nevertheless strong on NO COLLUSION and,17
ultimately,4
NO OBSTRUCTION...Anyway,7
how do you Obstruct when there is no crime and,11
in fact,2
the crimes were committed by the other side? Justin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands,30

two great new Supreme Court Justices,9
the Mexico City Policy,9
and a whole new &amp; positive attitude about the Right to Life,18
The Radical Left,5
with late term abortion (and worse),8
is imploding on this issue,8
We must stick together and Win...,8
for Life in 2020,9
If we are foolish and do not stay UNITED as one,14
all of our hard fought gains for Life can,10
and will,2
rapidly disappear,6
As most people know,5
and for those who would like to know,8
I am strongly Pro-Life,6
with the three exceptions - Rape,7
Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan,24
We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new....,21
Courts &amp; Dems in Congress,7
neither of which have a clue,7
are trying to FORCE migrants into our Country,13

With all of the Fake and Made Up News out there,11
Iran can have no idea what is actually going on,17
It now seems the General Flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge,24
It would have been impossible for me to know this but,14
if that was the case,5
and with me being one of two people who would become president,17
why was I not told so that I could make a change?,12
The Fake News Media is hurting our Country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of Iran,31
It is scattershot,5
poorly sourced (made up),5
and DANGEROUS,4
At least Iran doesn’t know what to think,11
which at this point may very well be a good thing,12
Will Jerry Nadler ever look into the fact that Crooked Hillary deleted and acid washed 33000 emails AFTER getting a most powerful demand notice for them from Congress?,51
My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on,14
Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics,17
A really bad situation,8
TREASON means long jail sentences,8
and this was TREASON,5

Will the Democrats give our Country a badly needed immigration win before the election? Good chance,28
All people that are illegally coming into the United States now will be removed from our Country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed,50

you will be leaving soon,6
Border Patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the Southern Border,22

are being registered and will be removed later,13
The Democrats now realize that there is a National Emergency at the Border and that,25
if we work together,6
it can be immediately fixed,9

Our great Senator (and Star) from the State of Arkansas,15
@TomCottonAR,5
has just completed a wonderful book,10
"“Sacred Duty,” about Arlington National Cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion",31
On sale today,4
make it big,3
China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates,24
as always,3
in order to make up for the business they are,12
and will be,3
losing,2
"If the Federal Reserve ever did a “match,” it would be game over",18
we win,2
In any event,5
China wants a deal,5

On sale today,4
make it big,3
Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now,28
Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product,24
the best,2
but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy.....,24
This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China,26
and others,3
to do business with us,6
The Farmers have been “forgotten” for many years,12
Their time is now,4
When the time is right we will make a deal with China,13
My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but,17
as I have told him many times before,10
this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense,22
We have to be allowed to make up some....,10
of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO,29
It will all happen,5
and much faster than people think,8
We can make a deal with China tomorrow,11
before their companies start leaving so as not to lose USA business,19
but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal,18
No way,2
We are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made,19
Will be taking in....,5
Billions of Dollars,5
and moving jobs back to the USA where they belong,14
Other countries are already negotiating with us because they don’t want this to happen to them,27
They must be a part of USA action,11
This should have been done by our leaders many years ago,15
Enjoy,2
so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers,16
We are now a much bigger economy than China,14
and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election,22
We are the “piggy bank” that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of,19
NO MORE,2
China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them,12
by almost 500 Billion Dollars,10
so we are in a fantastic position,11
Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff,17
You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China,17
Many companies are leaving China....,10
In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming,18
We placed a 25% Tariff on “dumped” steel from China &amp; other countries,22
and we now have a big and growing industry,12
We had to save Steel for our defense and auto industries,16
both of which are coming back strong,8
I met Marine Sgt,6

with his wonderful wife Jessica,9
He also wrote a book that I highly recommend,13
“Rebuilding Sergeant Peck.” https://t.co/eiNnHcEU7x,24
Wishing former President Jimmy Carter a speedy recovery from his hip surgery earlier today,28
He was in such good spirits when we spoke last month - he will be fine,16
Great to welcome Chairman Shin from Lotte Group to the WH,12
They just invested $3.1 BILLION into Louisiana-biggest investment in U.S,28

I officially updated my budget to include $18 million for our GREAT @SpecialOlympics,30

We must protect our Great Lakes,8
keeping them clean and beautiful for future generations,15
That’s why I am fighting for $300 million in my updated budget for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative,34
Under my Administration,8
we are restoring @NASA to greatness and we are going back to the Moon,20
then Mars,2
I am updating my budget to include an additional $1.6 billion so that we can return to Space in a BIG WAY,36
My Administration will be fighting for $200 million for the Army Corps Everglades restoration work this year,33
Congress needs to help us complete the world’s largest intergovernmental watershed restoration project ASAP,32
Good for Florida and good for the environment,13
There will be nobody left in China to do business with,15
Very bad for China,6
very good for USA,7
But China has taken so advantage of the U.S,14
for so many years,5
that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job),16
Therefore,2
China should not retaliate-will only get worse,13
There is no reason for the U.S,9
Consumer to pay the Tariffs,8
which take effect on China today,9
This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S.,19
21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree,23
Also,2
the Tariffs can be....,5
completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country,16
or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea),17
That’s Zero Tariffs,6
Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia,26
That’s why China wants to make a deal so badly!..,13
Democrat Rep,4
Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust,24
She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people,21

Bernie Sanders,4
“The Economy is doing well,9
and I’m sure I don’t have to give Trump any credit - I’m sure he’ll take all the credit that he wants.” Wrong Bernie,31

Crooked Hillary Clinton,7
had ever won,4
Has anyone noticed that all the Boston @RedSox have done is WIN since coming to the White House,25
Others also have done very well,9
The White House visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of Sports Illustrated,26
By the way,3
the Boston players were GREAT guys,8
The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China,28
Some people just don’t get it,8
Also,2
congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump (“thank you President Trump”),28
Thank you @foxandfriends,6
great show this morning and congratulations on your number one (by far) rating,20
Well deserved,3
I say openly to President Xi &amp; all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you don’t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries,55
Too expensive to buy in China,9
You had a great deal,5
almost completed,5
&amp; you backed out,5
Their is no reason for the U.S,9
Consumer to pay the Tariffs,8
which take effect on China today,9
This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S.,19

“It’s the attack strategy of harass,11
This is not about the Attorney General,12
who is very sophisticated &amp; knows it isn’t about him,19
it’s about trying to destroy President Trump through an assault on his AG for upholding the rule of law,28
He released a massive amount of.....,9

As long as President Trump is President,11
his opposition will use every tool,11
and misuse every tool available,11
to make his life miserable.” @TomFitton @JudicialWatch @LouDobbs Sadly,22
this proves I am doing a great job - Also,11
Best Economy and Employment Numbers EVER,13
“Just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the Democrats that began during the Obama Administration,40
continued through the Mueller FBI operation,14
&amp; now the baton has been passed to Jerry Nadler to continue to abuse power to harass President Trump.,31
and the Democrat National Committee-The Democrat Party apparatus-has been caught using donor Dollars to Collude with Russian Intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent (me),55
The FBI has no leadership,9
The Director is protecting the same gang.....that tried to...,14
overthrow the President through an illegal coup.” (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch,31
“Even Director James Clapper admits that the FBI actions against the Trump Presidential Campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying,39
perhaps FBI Director Christopher Wray will be the next to do so.” @LouDobbs,22
China is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden,11
or any of the others,7
gets elected in 2020,11
They LOVE ripping off America,9
The “Constitutional Crisis” is the Democrats refusing to work,18
Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border,23
When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course),19
it was supposed to be over,8
back to work for the people,7
"But the Dems have gone “nuts,” and it has actually gotten worse",16
Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020,17
or little will get done,6
Ever since the Mueller Report showed No Collusion &amp; No Obstruction,19
the Dems have been working overtime to damage me and the Republican Party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies,40
and with NO REASON,5
That’s all they want to do - don’t care about anything else,16
Despite two years and millions of dollars spent,11
the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public,28
But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started,17
It is all a big Hoax,6
the biggest in American history,11
The Democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a “Constitutional Crisis.” They and their partner,33
the Fake News Media,6
are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible,16
They are a sad JOKE,5
We may have the strongest Economy in our history,16
best..,1
employment numbers ever,7
low taxes &amp; regulations,9
a rebuilt military &amp; V.A.,11
many great new judges,6
&amp; so much more,5
But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation,18
a Witch Hunt,3
a Treasonous Hoax,5
That is the Constitutional Crisis &amp; hopefully guilty people will pay,21
We are right where we want to be with China,11
Remember,3
they broke the deal with us &amp; tried to renegotiate,15
We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China,19
Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal),17
or buy it from non-Tariffed countries..,9
We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture),34
which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received,14
and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world,18
GREAT,1

https://t.co/NlL3YNhxly,18
Think of it,3
I became President of the United States in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation,38
From long before I ever took office,10
I was under a sick &amp; unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the Russian...,28
Hoax,1
My campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the Democrats,24
This never happened before in American history,15
and it all turned out to be a total scam,11
a Witch Hunt,3
that yielded No Collusion,7
No Obstruction,4
This must never be allowed to happen again,12
“The Democrats have nothing,7
Just want to distract from this President,10
The FBI was not doing its job,10
the State Department was covering things up everyday for Hillary,18
At the end of the day they’re fearful of what they did,14
and should be fearful,5
This is a tough....,4
President who is willing to have the battle,12
and we have a great Attorney General who is willing to lead the battle,20
and they are going to get to the bottom of it.” @EdRollins @LouDobbs,20
I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller,11
and did not fire Bob Mueller,8
In fact,2
he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration,25
Actually,4
lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller,19
Never a big fan,5
The only problem is that they know I am going to win (best economy &amp; employment numbers in U.S,30
history,3
&amp; much more),4
and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term,25
Would be wise for them to act now,8
but love collecting BIG TARIFFS,8
I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election,38
2020,6
to see if they could get lucky &amp; have a Democrat win - in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year...,41
So now the Radical Left Dems don’t talk about Collusion anymore,19
because the Mueller Report said there was No Collusion,14
they only want to talk about Obstruction,11
even though there was No Obstruction or No Crime - except for the crimes committed by the other side,25
I won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am),32
and the voters didn’t care,8
Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter,20
Make it a part of the 2020 Election,15
Such an easy way to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA,26
It’s very simple,6

The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one,21
and conversations...,5
into the future will continue,9
In the meantime,4
the United States has imposed Tariffs on China,13
which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations,26

the greatest anywhere in the World,9
Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS,16
If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers,19
far more than China buys now,7
we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure,21
Healthcare,2
or anything else,5
China would greatly slow down,7
and we would automatically speed up,10
Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS,16
The average 401(k) balance has SOARED since the bottom of the market - 466%,31
Wow,1
Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER,11
not weaker,3
Just sit back and watch,5
In the meantime,4
China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S,14
at the last minute,5
This is not the Obama Administration,12
or the Administration of Sleepy Joe,11
who let China get away with “murder!”,10
Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind,29
Also,2
much easier &amp; quicker to do,10
Our Farmers will do better,8
faster,2
and starving nations can now be helped,9
Waivers on some products will be granted,10
or go to new source,5
The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars,36
The U.S,3
only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods &amp; products,23
a very big imbalance,7
With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in,18
we will buy....,3
agricultural products from our Great Farmers,13
in larger amounts than China ever did,11
and ship it to poor &amp; starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance,24
In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal,31
Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner - there is absolutely no need to rush - as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods &amp; products,67
These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S...,18

more than 30 years ago,7
were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would,17
if one was actively building,8
show losses and tax losses in almost all cases,13
Much was non monetary,7
"Sometimes considered “tax shelter,” .....",8
you would get it by building,7
or even buying,5
You always wanted to show losses for tax purposes....almost all real estate developers did - and often re-negotiate with banks,35

Puerto Rico has been given more money by Congress for Hurricane Disaster Relief,23
91 Billion Dollars,7
than any State in the history of the U.S,13
As an example,5
Florida got $12 Billion &amp; Texas $39 Billion for their monster hurricanes,27
Now the Democrats are saying NO Relief to.....,12
Alabama,4
Iowa,3
Nebraska,3
Georgia,2
South Carolina,5
North Carolina and others unless much more money is given to Puerto Rico,22
The Dems don’t want farmers to get any help,12
Puerto Rico should be very happy and the Dems should stop blocking much needed Disaster Relief,25
Scott Walker is 100% correct when he says that the Republicans must WAKE UP to the Democrats State by State power grab,34
They play very dirty,6
actually,4
like never before,5
Don’t allow them to get away with what they are doing,15
The United States has been losing,9
for many years,4
600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade,15
With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars,12

we’re not going to be doing that anymore,13
“Democrat Texas Congressman Al Green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent President Trump from re-election in 2020.” @OANN In other words,46

"there are “No High Crimes &amp; Misdemeanors,” No Collusion",15
No Conspiracy,5
No Obstruction,4
ALL THE CRIMES ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE,9

Nevertheless,4
the tables are turning,6

interviewing 500 people,9
using 18 Trump Hating Angry Democrats &amp; 49 FBI Agents - all culminating in a more than 400 page Report showing NO COLLUSION - why would the Democrats in Congress now need Robert Mueller......,58
to testify,4
Are they looking for a redo because they hated seeing the strong NO COLLUSION conclusion? There was no crime,28
except on the other side (incredibly not covered in the Report),18
and NO OBSTRUCTION,5
Bob Mueller should not testify,8
No redos for the Dems,6
For 10 months,3
China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech,29
and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods,16
These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results,21
The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday,16
325 Billions Dollars...,11
of additional goods sent to us by China remain untaxed,16
but will be shortly,5
at a rate of 25%,9
The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost,19
mostly borne by China,6

Nice,1
Anything in this very interesting world is possible,16

He also knows that I am with him &amp; does not want to break his promise to me,21

I didn’t call Bob Costa of the Washington Post,14
he called me (Returned his call),7
Just more Fake News,4
Congress has no time to legislate,9
they only want to continue the Witch Hunt,11
which I have already won,7
They should start looking at The Criminals who are already very well known to all,21
This was a Rigged System - WE WILL DRAIN THE SWAMP,11
No Collusion,4
No Obstruction - there has NEVER been a President who has been more transparent,20
Millions of pages of documents were given to the Mueller Angry Dems,19
plus I allowed everyone to testify,11
including W.H,7
counsel,2
I didn’t have to do this,8
but now they want more....,5
Can anyone comprehend what a GREAT job Border Patrol and Law Enforcement is doing on our Southern Border,30
So far this year they have APPREHENDED 418000 plus illegal immigrants,25
way up from last year,5
Mexico is doing very little for us,12
DEMS IN CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW,7
"are there no “High Crimes and Misdemeanors,” there are no Crimes by me at all",18
All of the Crimes were committed by Crooked Hillary,14
the Dems,2
the DNC and Dirty Cops - and we caught them in the act,15
We waited for Mueller and WON,8
so now the Dems look to Congress as last hope,11
The Mueller Report,5
despite being written by Angry Democrats and Trump Haters,16
and with unlimited money behind it ($35000000),18
didn’t lay a glove on me,8
I DID NOTHING WRONG,5
If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach,12
I would first head to the U.S,8
Supreme Court,3
Not only.....,3
Mexico’s Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers,20
probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border,20
Better not happen again,7
We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border,12
Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending &amp; returning,21
A very big Caravan of over 20000 people started up through Mexico,23
It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming,16
Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border &amp; call up the Military,34
The Coyotes &amp; Cartels have weapons,11
The American people deserve to know who is in this Country,17
Yesterday,3
the Supreme Court took up the Census Citizenship question,15
a really big deal,5
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
“Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson accuses United Kingdom Intelligence of helping Obama Administration Spy on the 2016 Trump Presidential Campaign.” @OANN WOW,54

currently paying 31%,10

We will Reciprocate,6
Dumb and Sick,3
A really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse,15
CNN has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster,19
In fact,2
it rewarded Chris Cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot,17
despite his massive failure in the morning,11
Only on CNN,6
Sorry to say but @foxandfriends is by far the best of the morning political shows on television,28
It rightfully has BY FAR the highest ratings,12
not even close,4
Morning Psycho (Joe),5
who helped get me elected in 2016 by having me on (free) all the time,23
has nosedived,3
too Angry..,3
In the “old days” if you were President and you had a good economy,19
you were basically immune from criticism,12
Remember,3
“It’s the economy stupid.” Today I have,13
as President,4
perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media,21
it means NOTHING,4
But it will,3
The Radical Left Democrats,8
together with their leaders in the Fake News Media,14
have gone totally insane,7
I guess that means that the Republican agenda is working,16
Stay tuned for more,4
I will be going to Green Bay,8

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time,19
as they did after the 2016 Election,15
But this one will have to be a far bigger &amp; better apology,19
On this one they will have to get down on their knees &amp; beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People,31
Paul Krugman,3
of the Fake News New York Times,7
has lost all credibility,8

Isn’t it amazing that the people who were closest to me,17
by far,2
and knew the Campaign better than anyone,11
were never even called to testify before Mueller,14
The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say ‘NO COLLUSION’ and only very good things,29
“A very exculpatory section of the Mueller Report: NO CONSPIRACY,21
COORDINATION or COLLUSION with the Trump Campaign and the Russians,18

Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment,15
There were no crimes by me (No Collusion,10
No Obstruction),4
so you can’t impeach,6
It was the Democrats that committed the crimes,12
not your Republican President,9
Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt,12
Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil,36
Iran is being given VERY BAD advice by @JohnKerry and people who helped him lead the U.S,27
into the very bad Iran Nuclear Deal,12
Big violation of Logan Act?,9

https://t.co/2UK8RgzRQL,19
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,34
Can you believe that I had to go through the worst and most corrupt political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States (No Collusion) when it was the “other side” that illegally created the diversionary &amp; criminal event and even spied on my campaign? Disgraceful,76
Jobless claims in the United States have reached their lowest (BEST) level in over 50 years,23
Despite No Collusion,6
No Obstruction,4
The Radical Left Democrats do not want to go on to Legislate for the good of the people,25
but only to Investigate and waste time,11
This is costing our Country greatly,10
and will cost the Dems big time in 2020,14
The Trump Haters and Angry Democrats who wrote the Mueller Report were devastated by the No Collusion finding,30
Nothing but a total “hit job” which should never have been allowed to start in the first place,22
Do you believe this? The New York Times Op-Ed: MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS OWE TRUMP AN APOLOGY,25

they got that one right,5

with an Economy that is the talk of the World and may be stronger than it has ever been before,26

political history is No Collusion with Russia (and No Obstruction),20
Pretty Amazing,5
United States weekly jobless claims just hit a 50 year low,16
The economy is doing GREAT,9
The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the Mueller Report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA,67
The Russia Hoax is dead,6
Despite the fact that the Mueller Report should not have been authorized in the first place &amp; was written as nastily as possible by 13 (18) Angry Democrats who were true Trump Haters,50
including highly conflicted Bob Mueller himself,13

all lies” @TuckerCarlson,7
“If dozens of Federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with a crime,22

the whole thing was a made up fraud),8
it is difficult to say that someone is obstructing something,16
There was no underlying crime.” @marthamaccallum @FoxNews,17
Anything the Russians did concerning the 2016 Election was done while Obama was President,30

The Mueller Report,5

Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities,35
We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level,18
especially by the State of California,11
which is well known or its poor management &amp; high taxes,15
Democrats must change the Immigration Laws FAST,12
If not,2
Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants - and this includes Gang Members,31
Drug Dealers,3
Human Traffickers,5
and Criminals of all shapes,7
sizes and kinds,4
CHANGE THE LAWS NOW,4
So interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other Sanctuary Cities NOT WANT our currently “detained immigrants” after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule,52
If they don’t want to serve our Nation by taking care of them,17
why should other cities &amp; towns?,9
I never offered Pardons to Homeland Security Officials,17
never ordered anyone to close our Southern Border (although I have the absolute right to do so,27
and may if Mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our Border),22
and am not “frustrated.” It is all Fake &amp; Corrupt News,15
When I won the Election in 2016,14
the @nytimes had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the Election (and me) so badly,31
They didn’t have a clue,7
it was pathetic,5
They even apologized to me,9
But now they are even worse,7
really corrupt reporting,7
The New York Times Sanctuary Cities/Immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact,31
They never call to check for truth,8
Their sources often don’t even exist,11

If the Radical Left Democrats all of a sudden don’t want the Illegal Migrants in their Sanctuary Cities (no more open arms),36
why should others be expected to take them into their communities? Go home and come into our Country legally and through a system of Merit,39

Due to the fact that Democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws,26
we are indeed,4
as reported,4
giving strong considerations to placing Illegal Immigrants in Sanctuary Cities only...,26
The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders,15

Congressman Jerry Nadler fought me for years on a very large development I built on the West Side of Manhattan,31

they are a Joke,4
In the meantime,4
the Democrats in Congress must help the Republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible,24
costly and foolish loopholes in our Immigration Laws,15
Once that happens,4
all will be smooth,4
We can NEVER allow Open Borders,10
it’s powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S.,30
and removing them back to their country of origin,14
Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous &amp; massive migration,19
we will be focusing on Border Security,13
not Ports of Entry...,5
We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Border’s specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States,57

HOW DID IT START?,4
So,1
let’s get this straight,5
There was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC,33

if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from,27

The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J,20
Trump,1
So many wonderful people,8
but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted,17
Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments,19
and so little appreciation,9
Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane,17
more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before,17
&amp; all their local politicians do is complain &amp; ask for more money,21
The pols are grossly incompetent,9
spend the money foolishly or corruptly,11
&amp; only take from USA...,9
the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job of bringing the Island back to health,27
91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico,12
and now the Dems want to give them more,9
taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others,17
Disgraceful,3
are GREAT,2
but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt,14
Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas &amp; Florida combined,19
yet their government can’t do anything right,12
the place is a mess - nothing works,8
FEMA &amp; the Military worked emergency miracles,17
but politicians like....,6
The Democrats today killed a Bill that would have provided great relief to Farmers and yet more money to Puerto Rico despite the fact that Puerto Rico has already been scheduled to receive more hurricane relief funding than any “place” in history,66
The people of Puerto Rico....,8
back the House,3
It will be truly great HealthCare that will work for America,16
Also,2
Republicans will always support Pre-Existing Conditions,16
The Republican Party will be known as the Party of Great HealtCare,18
Meantime,2
the USA is doing better than ever &amp; is respected again,20
are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) &amp; deductibles than ObamaCare,31
In other words it will be far less expensive &amp; much more usable than ObamaCare,24
Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate &amp; win.....,24
Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesn’t work,15
Premiums &amp; deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare,18
Even the Dems want to replace it,9
but with Medicare for all,7
which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance,26
The Republicans....,5
Democrats should stop fighting Sen,8
David Perdue’s disaster relief bill,11
They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America,22
No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report,27
it will never be good enough,8
Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing,9
The cost of ObamaCare is far too high for our great citizens,18

watch,1
Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA,34
Our detention areas are maxed out &amp; we will take no more illegals,21
Next step is to close the Border,8
This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico,16
It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws,27
In less than one hour,6
and then a vote,4
the problem would be solved,6

So funny that The New York Times &amp; The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion,50
So,1
they were either duped or corrupt? In any event,13
their prizes should be taken away by the Committee,14
The problem is,4
no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get,13
no matter what we give them,7
it will never be enough,7
Just watch,2
they will Harass &amp; Complain &amp; Resist (the theme of their movement),18
So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO,15
we’ve got a Country to run,8
Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats,17
until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!),23
After more than two years since the “insurance policy” statement was made by a dirty cop,23
I got the answers I wanted,8
the Truth....,2
Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates,13
especially since there is very little inflation,13
and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening,19
the 3.0% GDP,10
&amp; Stock Market,5
would have both been much higher &amp; World Markets would be in a better place,19
the Border,3
or large sections of the Border,8
next week,2
This would be so easy for Mexico to do,12
but they just take our money and “talk.” Besides,12
we lose so much money with them,8
especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.),15
that the Border closing would be a good thing,11
through their country and our Southern Border,11
Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S.,17
far greater than Border Costs,7
If Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border,37
I will be CLOSING....,5
The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World,22
Mexico has the strongest,7
&amp; they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S,19
Therefore,2
CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW,13
&amp; Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S...,17

So many leaving New York,7

All part of the Witch Hunt,6
https://t.co/5HCCNFZXFN,19
New York State and its Governor,8
Andrew Cuomo,4
are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS,16
No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers,15
The Witch Hunt continues,6
needed,2
and the complexity creates danger,10
All of this for great cost yet very little gain,12
I don’t know about you,7
but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot,14
I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane,26
Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly,12
Pilots are no longer needed,8
but rather computer scientists from MIT,13
I see it all the time in many products,11
Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further,15
when often old and simpler is far better,12
Split second decisions are...,7
Patrick Moore,3
co-founder of Greenpeace: “The whole climate crisis is not only Fake News,18
it’s Fake Science,5
There is no climate crisis,7
there’s weather and climate all around the world,12
and in fact carbon dioxide is the main building block of all life.” @foxandfriends Wow,22
“Jewish people are leaving the Democratic Party,14
We saw a lot of anti Israel policies start under the Obama Administration,25
and it got worsts &amp; worse,7
There is anti-Semitism in the Democratic Party,16
They don’t care about Israel or the Jewish people.” Elizabeth Pipko,21
Jexodus,3
Republican Senators have a very easy vote this week,16
It is about Border Security and the Wall (stopping Crime,16
Drugs etc.),5
not Constitutionality and Precedent,12
It is an 80% positive issue,12
The Dems are 100% United,11
as usual,4
on a 20% issue,8
Open Borders and Crime,6
Get tough R’s,4
Making Daylight Saving Time permanent is O.K,13
with me,2
At a recent round table meeting of business executives,16
&amp; long after formally introducing Tim Cook of Apple,17
I quickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple as an easy way to save time &amp; words,26
The Fake News was disparagingly all over this,13
&amp; it became yet another bad Trump story,13
“There’s not one shred of evidence that President Trump has done anything wrong.” @GrahamLedger One America News,30
So true,2
a total Witch Hunt - All started illegally by Crooked Hillary Clinton,20
the DNC and others,7
More people are working today in the United States,14
158000000,9
than at any time in our Country’s history,14
That is a Big Deal,5
Despite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of American politics,25
the Trump Administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other Administration,27
Judges,2
biggest Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts,10
V.A,2
Choice,1
Best Economy,5
Lowest Unemployment &amp; much more,10

The Witch Hunt continues,6
https://t.co/9W1iUgE0d6,23
and renovated,5
with MUCH MORE to follow shortly,8
Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended (captured) at the Border and NOT allowed into our Country,31
With another President,7
millions would be pouring in,7
I am stopping an invasion as the Wall gets built,13
#MAGA,4
Wacky Nut Job @AnnCoulter,8
who still hasn’t figured out that,9
despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight),42
I am winning on the Border,8
Major sections of Wall are being built..,10
I hope the grandstanding Governor of California is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called Fast Train,52
which is $Billions over budget &amp; in total disarray,18
Time to reduce taxes in California,11
Border Patrol and Law Enforcement has apprehended (captured) large numbers of illegal immigrants at the Border,30
They won’t be coming into the U.S,11
The Wall is being built and will greatly help us in the future,16
and now,2

Congratulations to Heather Wilson,10
who is the sole finalist to become the next President of University of Texas at El Paso effective September 1,35
2019,6
Heather has done an absolutely fantastic job..,13
as Secretary of the Air Force,9
and I know she will be equally great in the very important world of higher education,25
A strong thank you to Heather for her service,11
Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon,27
His lawyers totally contradicted him,11
He lied,2
Additionally,5
he directly asked me for a pardon,10
I said NO,3
He lied again,4
He also badly wanted to work at the White House,13
He lied,2

Things are looking good,5
We are apprehending record numbers of illegal immigrants - but we need the Wall to help our great Border Patrol Agents,33
“This is as good a time as I can remember to be an American Worker,21
We have the strongest economy in the world.” Stuart Varney @foxandfriends So true,22
Both the Judge and the lawyer in the Paul Manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was NO COLLUSION with Russia,34
But the Witch Hunt Hoax continues as you now add these statements to House &amp; Senate Intelligence &amp; Senator Burr,31
So bad for our Country,7
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT,7
I cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media,18
It is totally out of control,9
but we are winning,5
Thank you @foxandfriends,6
Great show,2
The Wall is being built and is well under construction,14
Big impact will be made,6
Many additional contracts are close to being signed,14
Far ahead of schedule despite all of the Democrat Obstruction and Fake News,20
Breaking News @MSNBC: “Cohen’s lawyer contradicts Cohen’s testimony about never seeking a Presidential Pardon.”,36
We are on track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year,26
Great job by Border Patrol (and others) who are working in a Broken System,20
Can be fixed by Congress so easily and quickly if only the Democrats would get on board,24
It was not a campaign contribution,10
and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me,17
Fake News,2
Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate,14
Good,1
then I think I’ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates,34
Wall Street Journal: “More migrant families crossing into the U.S,17
illegally have been arrested in the first five months of the federal fiscal year than in any prior full year.” We are doing a great job at the border,41
but this is a National Emergency,11
Congressman Chris Stewart: “No one is accusing the President of a crime and yet they (the Democrats) are issuing hundreds of subpoenas,36
This is unprecedented.” They are desperately trying to find anything they can,22
even a punctuation mistake in a document,14
American Workforce Policy Advisory Board Meeting at the @WhiteHouse,21
https://t.co/izb2tTrINB,16
It is shameful that House Democrats won’t take a stronger stand against Anti-Semitism in their conference,29
Anti-Semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it’s inconceivable they will not act to condemn it,34
Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent,22
they are voting on desperately needed Border Security &amp; the Wall,21
Our Country is being invaded with Drugs,12
Human Traffickers,5
&amp; Criminals of all shapes and sizes,11
That’s what this vote is all about,9

https://t.co/AHz6kLliaC,17
“(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020,20

does that mean I won’t get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed,20
Scott Gottlieb,3
who has done an absolutely terrific job as Commissioner of the FDA,22

Scott has helped us to lower drug prices,10

He and his talents will be greatly missed,10

PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT,7
The greatest overreach in the history of our Country,16
The Dems are obstructing justice and will not get anything done,16
A big,2

fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime,15
when in fact the real crime is what the Dems are doing,13
and have done,3
“HIV Is Cured In 2nd Patient,8

“The American Media has changed forever,13

Presidential Harassment,7
https://t.co/2Cz5ckERcs,17
“There is no Collusion,6
All of these investigations are in search of a crime,14
Democrats have no evidence to impeach President Trump,15
Ridiculous!” @DevinNunes @FoxNews,11
“Now that the Dems are going to try &amp; switch from Collusion to some other reason,22
it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn’t accept the WILL OF THE PEOPLE in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the President.” @AriFleischer It will never work,54
The military drills,6
or war games as I call them,7
were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK—FAKE NEWS,21
I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S,16
far too much money to have those “games”,9
especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost,16
FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes,46

https://t.co/QFqCaYmVPJ,14
For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar &amp; fraudster,24
at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea,21
is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the “walk.” Never done when a president is overseas,36
Shame,1
President,3
We are WINNING big,5
the envy of the WORLD,6
but just think what it could be?,7
Presidential Harassment by “crazed” Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country,28
Likewise,2
the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure - Yet the most successful first two years for any,37
The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S,32
for which we are not reimbursed,8
That was my position long before I became President,15
Also,2
reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing,17
My wonderful daughter,6

She works so hard and has achieved so much for the U.S.A.(and gets so little credit!),22
Then watch Mark Levin at 10:00 P.M.,11
a great show,3
“Look how they’re acting now and how we act when we’re in the majority,20
What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power,15
They couldn’t find anything...they took a Fake Dossier &amp; couldn’t find any Collusion,25
Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.” Congressman Mark Green,15
(R-TN),3
After more than two years of Presidential Harassment,14
the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law,20
The hostile Cohen testimony,9
given by a liar to reduce his prison time,13
proved no Collusion,5
His just written book manuscript showed what he....,11
said was a total lie,6
but Fake Media won’t show it,9
I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad,18
conflicted &amp; corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal &amp; should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election,40
Despite this,3
great success,3

Congrats to SPACEX and all,7
The brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer Michael Cohen shows his testimony was a total lie,29
Pundits should only use it,7
Virtually everything failed lawyer Michael Cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me,46
It’s a total new love letter to “Trump” and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction,29

I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef,30
pork,1
etc.) based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions...,22
and I did not increase their second traunch of Tariffs to 25% on March 1st,23
This is very important for our great farmers - and me,15
for Otto’s mistreatment and death,9
Most important,4
Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain,11
Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength,22
which will last for many years into the future,12
I love Otto and think of him often,10
I never like being misinterpreted,11
but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family,19
Remember,3
I got Otto out along with three others,11
The previous Administration did nothing,12
and he was taken on their watch,8
Of course I hold North Korea responsible...,12
Michael Cohen’s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before,25
He must have forgotten about his book when he testified,15
What does Hillary Clinton’s lawyer,10
Lanny Davis,4
say about this one,5
Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary,11
Using her lawyer?,5
and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday,16
No way,2
it’s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt,16
Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed,17
Republicans have been abused long enough,11
Must end now,3
Oh’ I see,3
Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart,16
there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats,19
they say,2
“gee,1
I have an idea,6
let’s look at Trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done,19
Let’s follow discredited Michael Cohen....,12
Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohen’s new book,16
given to publishers a short time ago,11
Your heads will spin when you see the lies,9
misrepresentations and contradictions against his Thursday testimony,20
Like a different person,7
He is totally discredited,9
Wow,1
just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a “love letter to Trump” manuscript for a new book that he was pushing,27
Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki,16
his phony reasons for going rogue,9
Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony,14
which now is a lie,5
Great to be back from Vietnam,8
an amazing place,5
We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un - we know what they want and they know what we must have,28
Relationship very good,7

Great meetings and dinner tonight in Vietnam with Kim Jong Un of North Korea,21
Very good dialogue,6
Resuming tomorrow,6
All false reporting (guessing) on my intentions with respect to North Korea,20
Kim Jong Un and I will try very hard to work something out on Denuclearization &amp; then making North Korea an Economic Powerhouse,40
I believe that China,6

Thank you Fiat Chrysler,6
They are all coming back to the USA,11
it’s where the action is,7
Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately),22
He had other clients also,8
He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying &amp; fraud,17
He did bad things unrelated to Trump,10
He is lying in order to reduce his prison time,14
Using Crooked’s lawyer,7
I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal,17
the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?),19
His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there,26
We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders,14
The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didn’t do “it” during eight years of the Obama Administration?,46
Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth,12
North Korea would be the same,8
and very quickly,5
if it would denuclearize,8
The potential is AWESOME,7
a great opportunity,7
like almost none other in history,10
for my friend Kim Jong Un,6
We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting,12
Just arrived in Vietnam,7
Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi,17
Tremendous crowds,4
and so much love,4
This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress,22
If there is one thing we should all agree on,11
it’s protecting the lives of innocent babies,13
Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children,27
The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they don’t mind executing babies AFTER birth...,30
If a deal is made with China,8
our great American Farmers will be treated better than they have ever been treated before,25
Heading over to Vietnam for my meeting with Kim Jong Un,16
Looking forward to a very productive Summit,13

It is my honor today to announce that Danny Burch,14

“Why on earth would any Republican vote not to put up a Wall or against Border Security,26
Please explain that to me?” @Varneyco,10
I hope our great Republican Senators don’t get led down the path of weak and ineffective Border Security,32
Without strong Borders,5
we don’t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us,16
Be strong and smart,4
don’t fall into the Democrats “trap” of Open Borders and Crime,17
Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career,26

Meeting for breakfast with our Nation’s Governors - then off to Vietnam for a very important Summit with Kim Jong Un,33

As a result of these very.....,8
So funny to watch people who have failed for years,12

Chairman Kim realizes,7
perhaps better than anyone else,9
that without nuclear weapons,8
his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World,23
Because of its location and people (and him),12
it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation,17
President Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un,25
The last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door,17
Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful,19
Great relationship with Chairman Kim,9
Very productive talks yesterday with China on Trade,14
Will continue today,6
I will be leaving for Hanoi,8
Vietnam,3
early tomorrow for a Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea,18

The Border Committee Democrats are behaving,13
all of a sudden,5
irrationally,5
Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts),37
but they don’t even want to take muderers into custody,17
What’s going on?,5
“President is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency,20
There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976,34

so this is hardly unprecedented.” Congressman @tommcclintock,18
The fact is,3
when I took over as President,9
our Country was a mess,7
Depleted Military,7
Endless Wars,3
a potential War with North Korea,10
V.A.,2
High Taxes &amp; too many Regulations,12

In fact,2
I probably work more hours than almost any past President....,17
It was a very bad week for the Democrats,12
with the GREAT economic numbers,9
The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address,16
Now,1
with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee,19
I actually believe they want a Shutdown,12
They want a new subject,6
I don’t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal,26
They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall &amp; now,25
out of the blue,4
want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention,19

they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA,13
Is anybody really surprised by this?,11

Liz,1
The Democrats just don’t seem to want Border Security,16
They are fighting Border Agents recommendations,13
If you believe news reports,7
they are not offering much for the Wall,10
They look to be making this a campaign issue,12
The Wall will get built one way or the other,11
We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks,33
If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election,17

and don’t let the Democrats sound bites fool you,12
The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see,26
When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn,23
The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win,30

Someday the Fake News Media will turn honest &amp; report that Donald J,20
Trump was actually a GREAT Candidate,11
The mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the VERY important Senate Intelligence Committee,33
after two years of intensive study and access to Intelligence that only they could get,24
just stated that they have found NO COLLUSION between “Trump” &amp; Russia...,18
Now we find out that Adam Schiff was spending time together in Aspen with Glenn Simpson of GPS Fusion,28
who wrote the fake and discredited Dossier,11
even though Simpson was testifying before Schiff,13
John Solomon of @thehill,8
Not only did Senator Burr’s Committee find No Collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia,25
it’s important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300000 pages of documents,29
&amp; the Committee has direct access to intelligence information that’s Classified,25
@GreggJarrett,4

Syria was loaded with ISIS until I came along,15
We will soon have destroyed 100% of the Caliphate,16
but will be watching them closely,8
It is now time to start coming home and,10
after many years,5
spending our money wisely,8
Certain people must get smart,7
I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan,18
the “Endless Wars” of unlimited spending and death,13
During my campaign I said,7
very strongly,4
that these wars must finally end,8
We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace..,28

WITCH HUNT,2
Just out: The big deal,5
very mysterious Don jr telephone calls,13
after the innocent Trump Tower meeting,11
that the media &amp; Dems said were made to his father (me),16
were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me,13
They were made to friends &amp; business associates of Don,15
Really sad,3
Our great U.S,5
Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country’s history,23
Thanks,1
as always,3
for a job well done,5
I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday,16
A false narrative is so bad for our Country,13
I value our intelligence community,13
Happily,3
we had a very good meeting,8
and we are all on the same page,8
Just concluded a great meeting with my Intel team in the Oval Office who told me that what they said on Tuesday at the Senate Hearing was mischaracterized by the media - and we are very much in agreement on Iran,59

Very sadly,4
Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017,29
to 33341,13
This is a big contributor to the Humanitarian Crisis taking place on our Southern Border and then spreading throughout our Country,38
Worse even than Afghanistan,8
Much caused by DRUGS,4
Wall is being built,5
Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran,20
They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country,20
Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination,24
Dems put us in a bad place - but now good,10
Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services,21
which they are now doing,6
but also to our Manufacturing,11
Farmers and other U.S,7
businesses and industries,7
Without this a deal would be unacceptable,12
More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals,24
through large Caravans,5
into our Country,6
We have stopped the previous Caravans,10
and we will stop these also,7
With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive,17
Being Built,3
Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion,16
high taxes,3
Open Borders and Crime,6
Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time,20
Democrats,3
despite all of the evidence,8
proof and Caravans coming,7
are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL,18
I’ve got you covered,6
Wall is already being built,8
I don’t expect much help,7
China’s representatives and I are trying to do a complete deal,19
leaving NOTHING unresolved on the table,11
All of the many problems are being discussed and will be hopefully resolved,20
Tariffs on China increase to 25% on March 1st,17
so all working hard to complete by that date,11
meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the Oval Office,21
No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi,15
and I,2
meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points,25
Very comprehensive transaction...,9
China’s top trade negotiators are in the U.S,15
meeting with our representatives,10
Meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides,16
China does not want an increase in Tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal,24
They are correct,4
I will be.....,3
With Murders up 33% in Mexico,13
a record,3
why wouldn’t any sane person want to build a Wall,14
Construction has started and will not stop until it is finished,16
@LouDobbs @foxandfriends,7

Wall is being built,5
Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games,17
A WALL is a WALL,5
Large sections of WALL have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go,26
Renovation of existing WALLS is also a very big part of the plan to finally,24
after many decades,6
properly Secure Our Border,9
The Wall is getting done one way or the other,12
So great to watch &amp; listen to all these people who write books &amp; talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning,41
and how I should be doing “IT.” As I take it all in,14
I then sit back,4
look around,3
&amp; say “gee,4

Be careful of Iran,6
Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school,11
The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran,28
They are wrong,3

If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier,43
they are Wasting their time,6
Time will tell what will happen with North Korea,12
but at the end of the previous administration,14
relationship was horrendous and very bad things were about to happen,19
Now a whole different story,8
I look forward to seeing Kim Jong Un shortly,12
Progress being made-big difference,9
Fighting continues but the people of Afghanistan want peace in this never ending war,23
We will soon see if talks will be successful? North Korea relationship is best it has ever been with U.S,29
No testing,3
getting remains,4
hostages returned,5
Decent chance of Denuclearization..,11
When I became President,7
ISIS was out of control in Syria &amp; running rampant,17
Since then tremendous progress made,8
especially over last 5 weeks,8
Caliphate will soon be destroyed,8
unthinkable two years ago,8
Negotiating are proceeding well in Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting.,23
Maduro willing to negotiate with opposition in Venezuela following U.S,25
sanctions and the cutting off of oil revenues,12
Guaido is being targeted by Venezuelan Supreme Court,16
Massive protest expected today,9
Americans should not travel to Venezuela until further notice,19
“Our economy,6

and not even close,5
A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction,31
He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer,22
He signed a non-disclosure agreement,10
He is a mess,4
How does Da Nang Dick (Blumenthal) serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee when he defrauded the American people about his so called War Hero status in Vietnam,47
only to later admit,7

that he was never in Vietnam,9
An embarrassment to our Country,10

Howard Schultz doesn’t have the “guts” to run for President,15

Large parts of the Country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold,25
Amazing how big this system is,9
Wouldn’t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now,22
Always heard that as President,8
“it’s all about the economy!” Well,11
we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country,20
Big GDP,4
lowest unemployment,6
companies coming back to the U.S,10
in BIG numbers,4
great new trade deals happening,7
&amp; more,3
But LITTLE media mention,8
https://t.co/bJ81QkOObW,19
I will be live from the White House at 4:00 P.M,14
Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States,29
We stopped the last two - many are still in Mexico but can’t get through our Wall,21
but it takes a lot of Border Agents if there is no Wall,15
Not easy,3
Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up),54
as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story &amp; the even more disgraceful coverage,25
The Economy is one of the best in our history,16
with unemployment at a 50 year low,11
and the Stock Market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - &amp; all you heard yesterday,28
based on a phony story,7
was Impeachment,4
You want to see a Stock Market Crash,9
Impeach Trump,3
@newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since Abraham Lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite President,45
me,1
At the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office,25
Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country,34
Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE,13
"Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited “Dossier,” paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research)",42
on which the entire Russian probe is based,11
A very sad day for journalism,10
but a great day for our Country,9

I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border,30
and the Shutdown,4
tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M.,10
live from the @WhiteHouse,6
https://t.co/6xciJ0ubp0,21
AMERICA FIRST,5
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
Never seen the Republican Party so unified,14
No “Cave” on the issue of Border and National Security,17
A beautiful thing to see,7
especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the Democrats who talk Open Border,27
High Taxes and Crime,5
Stop Criminals &amp; Drugs now,8
Kevin Corke,3
@FoxNews “Don’t forget,7
Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud,18
and as recently as this week,8
the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....” Lying to reduce his jail time,30
Watch father-in-law,5
Another big Caravan heading our way,12
Very hard to stop without a Wall,9
“It’s the Democrats keeping everything closed.” @JimInhofe So true,18
Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800000 great people are not getting paid,39
Also,2
could somebody please explain to Nancy &amp; her “big donors” in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in,35
Border rancher: “We’ve found prayer rugs out here,11
It’s unreal.” Washington Examiner People coming across the Southern Border from many countries,27
some of which would be a big surprise,9
Gregg Jarrett: “Mueller’s prosecutors knew the “Dossier” was the product of bias and deception.” It was a Fake,29
just like so much news coverage in our Country,13
Nothing but a Witch Hunt,6
from beginning to end,6
“In 2018 alone,9
20000 illegal aliens with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the Border,28
and there was a 122% increase in fentanyl being smuggled between ports of entry,29
Last month alone,4
more than 20000 minors were smuggled into the U.S.” @seanhannity,21
Thank you to Amy Kremer,7
Women for Trump Co-Founder,7
for doing such a great interview with Martha MacCallum...and by the way,19
women have the lowest unemployment numbers in many decades - at the highest pay ever,24
Proud of that,3
So funny to watch Schumer groveling,10
He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM,21
The Left has become totally unhinged,10
They no longer care what is Right for our Countrty,13
It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime,30
They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border,25
#2020,8
There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world,21
with 45 countries planning or building Walls,12
Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015,23
They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful,18
Stop the crime at our Southern Border,10
Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House,21
Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid),18
over 1000 hamburgers etc,12
Within one hour,5
it was all gone,4
Great guys and big eaters,6
Congratulations @ClemsonFB,8
https://t.co/w8viax0OWY,23
Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?,19
Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House,21

Great guys and big eaters,6
Polls are now showing that people are beginning to understand the Humanitarian Crisis and Crime at the Border,31
Numbers are going up fast,7
over 50%,6
Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime,13
Ridiculous that they don’t want Border Security,15
A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras,21
Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them,16
Only a Wall will work,6
Only a Wall,4
or Steel Barrier,5
will keep our Country safe,7
Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown,13
Volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in Chattanooga,19
Tennessee,3
They will be making Electric Cars,9
Congratulations to Chattanooga and Tennessee on a job well done,19
A big win,3
Just announced that Veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low,18
really good news for our Vets and their families,13
Will soon be an all time low,7
Do you think the media will report on this and all of the other great economic news?,24
The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin’ James Comey and the so-called “leaders” of the FBI,42
Twelve have been fired or forced to leave,9
They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation,19
Bad,1
I am doing exactly what I pledged to do,12
and what I was elected to do by the citizens of our great Country,20
Just as I promised,5
I am fighting for YOU,6
For decades,3
politicians promised to secure the border,12
fix our trade deals,5
bring back our factories,7
get tough on China,5
move the Embassy to Jerusalem,10
make NATO pay their fair share,7
and so much else - only to do NOTHING (or worse)...,12
Spoke w/ President Erdogan of Turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of ISIS,44
and 20 mile safe zone,6
Also spoke about economic development between the U.S,18
&amp; Turkey - great potential to substantially expand,15
Getting ready to go on stage at the #AFBF100 in New Orleans - packed house,22

The Fake News gets crazier and more dishonest every single day,18
Amazing to watch as certain people covering me,14
and the tremendous success of this administration,14
have truly gone MAD,5
Their Fake reporting creates anger and disunity,14
Take two weeks off and come back rested,9

Love our farmers,5
love Tennessee - a great combination,10
See you in a little while,7
Nancy and Cryin’ Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes,16
At this point it has become their,8
and the Democrats,5
fault,1
I’ve been waiting all weekend,8
Democrats must get to work now,8
Border must be secured,6
“Gas prices drop across the United States because President Trump has deregulated Energy and we are now producing a great deal more oil than ever before.” @foxandfriends But this is bad news for Russia,55
why would President Trump do such a thing? Thought he worked for Kremlin?,16
Border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the United States,26
as we have known it,5
is going to cease to exist...And Americans will not go gentle into that good night,23
Patrick Buchanan,5
The great people of our Country demand proper Border Security NOW,20
The Trump portrait of an unsustainable Border Crisis is dead on,18

Best line in the Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe is,16
to her husband,4
“Thank you for being here,6
I’m glad you’re here” It’s their house,10
he’s supposed to be there,7
If Elizabeth Warren,7
often referred to by me as Pocahontas,12
did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen,18
with her husband dressed in full Indian garb,11
it would have been a smash,6

So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting,27
I understand,4
is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper,19
the Amazon Washington Post,8
Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better &amp; more responsible hands,21
Likewise,2
do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey,10
Russia,2
Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S,23
policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies,19
We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home,18
Stop the ENDLESS WARS,5
Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard,33
and from many directions,7
Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms,16
Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds,15
Create 20 mile safe zone...,7
Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden,36
Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY,9
SPECIAL PLACE,3
Thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in Texas prisons,30
Most came through our Southern Border,9
We can end this easily - We need a Steel Barrier or Wall,16
Walls Work,2
John Jones,2
Texas Department of Public Safety,10
@FoxNews,3
The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs,18
Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown,15
which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington,18
I’m in the White House,6
waiting,2
The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay,19
They are having fun and not even talking,11
The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country,26
Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and don’t want to include in talks,22
Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side,18
watch,1
I will be interviewed by Jeanine Pirro at 9:00 P.M,17
on @FoxNews,4
Watch @JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after,15
All terrific people,6
I am in the White House waiting for Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy to call so we can start helping our Country both at the Border and from within,36
https://t.co/3IH1yW2eTg,19
We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border,20
We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their “vacations” and get back to work,26
I am in the White House ready to sign,10
I do have a plan on the Shutdown,9
But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election,23
and I promised safety and security for the American people,19
Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border,14
Elections have consequences,8
I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is “chaotic,25
there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown,14
There is no plan.” The Fakes always like talking Chaos,13
there is NONE,3
In fact,2
there’s almost nobody in the W.H,13
but me,2
and..,1
Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes,13
Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man,13
Tell them to get it done,6
Humanitarian Crisis,8
23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants,18
Border arrests are up 240%,14
In the Great State of Texas,7
between 2011 &amp; 2018,17
there were a total of 292000 crimes by illegal aliens,23
539 murders,9
32000 assaults,7
3426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges,23
Democrats come back,5
Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown,17
while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border,26
I am in the White House waiting for you,10
Lyin’ James Comey,5
Andrew McCabe,4
Peter S and his lover,7
agent Lisa Page,5
&amp; more,3
all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act,13
These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President,20
Part of the Witch Hunt,5
Remember the “insurance policy?” This is it,13
I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama,13
Bush or Clinton,4
Maybe tougher than any other President,12
At the same time,4
&amp; as I have often said,8
getting along with Russia is a good thing,11
not a bad thing,4
I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again,20
who is being totally protected by his best friend,14
Bob Mueller,3
&amp; the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton,41
her Campaign,3
and the Democratic National Committee,12
Just Watch,2
the FBI was in complete turmoil (see N.Y,13
Post) because of Comey’s poor leadership and the way he handled the Clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the Justice Department),40
My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,16
He was a Crooked Cop.....,6
Funny thing about James Comey,8
Everybody wanted him fired,9
Republican and Democrat alike,10
After the rigged &amp; botched Crooked Hillary investigation,17
where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend,14
not recorded or sworn in,7
"and where she said she didn’t know anything (a lie),...",14
Wow,1
just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI,22
almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons,20
opened up an investigation on me,11
for no reason &amp; with no proof,9
after I fired Lyin’ James Comey,10
a total sleaze,4
@CNN called a San Diego news station (@KUSINews) for negative reports on the Wall,26
When the station said that Walls work,8
CNN no longer had interest,10

Drug prices declined in 2018,12
the first time in nearly half a century,11
During the first 19 months of my Administration,14
Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs,17

January 14th,8
What a game,3
what a coach,3
what a team,3
The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven’t built any NEW WALL,18
Below is a section just completed on the Border,14
Anti-climbing feature included,9
Very high,3
strong and beautiful,5
Also,2
many miles already renovated and in service,14
https://t.co/UAAGXl5Byr,17
The Steel Barrier,5
or Wall,2
should have been built by previous administrations long ago,16
They never got it done - I will,8
Without it,3
our Country cannot be safe,8
Criminals,3
Gangs,1
Human Traffickers,5
Drugs &amp; so much other big trouble can easily pour in,16
It can be stopped cold,5
Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border,15
I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand,24
an invasion,4
I have been there numerous times - The Democrats,12
Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy don’t know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY...,25
H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay,37
including a potential path to citizenship,13
We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S,26
I often said during rallies,8
with little variation,7
that “Mexico will pay for the Wall.” We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico,22
It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces,24
The difference pays for Wall many times over,12
When I took the Oath of Office...,8
https://t.co/GDhIqteKpv,15
We lose 300 Americans a week,11
90% of which comes through the Southern Border,13
These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall,15

“Great support for Border Security and the Wall.” @foxandfriends Even greater than anyone would know,27
“Presidents supporters do not want him to cave.” @SteveDoocy I won’t,20
There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate,18
despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise,23
The Opposition Party &amp; the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security,22
but don’t want to give “Trump” another one of many wins,15
Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I “slammed the table &amp; walked out of the room,30
He had a temper tantrum.” Because I knew he would say that,15
and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security,16
I politely said bye-bye and left,9
no slamming,3
Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon,8
somewhat of a White House tradition or custom,12
to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting,20
Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media,17
which has gone totally bonkers,8
The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now,18
NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy,13
They report stories,5
purposely,3
the exact opposite of the facts,9
They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems,16
May even be worse than Fake News CNN,11
if that is possible,6
Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy,10
a total waste of time,6
I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up,21
are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said,26
NO,1
I said bye-bye,4
nothing else works,4
Thank you to all of America's brave police,12

I have ordered FEMA to send no more money,12
It is a disgraceful situation in lives &amp; money,16
Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forrest fires that,21

Economic numbers looking REALLY good,11
Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration,27
rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today,16
That would have been SO EASY,7
Still,1
markets up BIG since 2016 Election,14
Endless Wars,3
especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago,21
&amp; those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing,37

Congressman Adam Smith,6
the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,14
just stated,3
“Yes,1
there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency,22
It’s been done a number of times.” No doubt,11
but let’s get our deal done in Congress,11
The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party,20
It is truly the Enemy of the People,12
We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting,16
The Fake News will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the Trump Administration,29
and me,2
look as bad as possible,7
They use non-existent sources &amp; write stories that are total fiction,19
Our Country is doing so well,9
yet this is a sad day in America,11
With all of the success that our Country is having,14
including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts,15

Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today,26

We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete,15
It is both stronger &amp; less obtrusive,11

Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East,25
President El-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future,20
The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work,17
99% of our illegal Border crossings will end,17
crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year,21
A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year,20

A big Human Trafficking problem,9
I don’t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats,18
I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security,24
I am in the White House ready to go,10
where are the Dems?,4
Many people currently a part of my opposition,15
including President Obama &amp; the Dems,13
have had campaign violations,8
in some cases for very large sums of money,12
These are civil cases,6
They paid a fine &amp; settled,8
While no big deal,4
I did not commit a campaign violation,12
The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time,21
All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall),20
something which everyone,6
other than drug dealers,6
human traffickers and criminals,9
want very badly,5
This would be so easy to do,8
Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,31
Teams negotiating this weekend,9
Washington Post and NBC reporting of events,14
including Fake sources,6
has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly),13

How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time,23
done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia,11
it was the Dems that Colluded),8
had the most successful first two years of any president,15
and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?,22
As I have stated many times,8
if the Democrats take over the House or Senate,13
there will be disruption to the Financial Markets,13
We won the Senate,5
they won the House,4
Things will settle down,5
They only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020,23
too much success,4
President Trump deserves a lot of credit,11
but again,3
you have the anti-Trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit.”,21

The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly,42
In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on,25
At some point this had to be done,8
The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election,23
"The Democrats know they can’t win based on all of the achievements of “Trump,” so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment",50

Sadly,2
there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall,15
I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders,25
supports the agents and officers on the ground,12
and keeps America Safe,7
Let’s get it done,5
Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress,28
Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people – this is the first and most important duty of government..,39
Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal,17
Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built,17
We have done a lot of work,7
$5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security,38
Quick payback,3
Here we go with Mitt Romney,7
but so fast,3
Question will be,4
is he a Flake? I hope not,7
Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful,28

He should be happy for all Republicans,11

Remember this,4
Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change,16
You have Walls and you have Wheels,7
It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way,14
Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL,25
The Democrats will probably submit a Bill,12
being cute as always,6
which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security,18
namely the Wall,4
You see,2
without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech “stuff” is just,19
by comparison,5
meaningless bells &amp; whistles..,8
MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A,25

more than a year longer than any other Administration in history,20
These are people who have been approved by committees and all others,17

Very Unfair,4
It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn’t work,29
It does,2
and properly built,5
almost 100%,7
They say it’s old technology - but so is the wheel,14
They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying,23
I’m in the Oval Office,8
Democrats,3
come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security,23
including the Wall,5
You voted yes in 2006 and 2013,17

I’ll get it built,5

I am the only person in America who could say that,16
“I’m bringing our great troops back home,10
"with victory,” and get BAD press",8
It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining,20
If I stayed in Endless Wars forever,10
they would still be unhappy,7
I campaigned on Border Security,10
which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall,14
"Our Southern Border has long been an “Open Wound,” where drugs",15
criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country,23
Dems should get back here an fix now,8
Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be,20
I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS,11
remember,3
I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places,16
Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media,13
or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived,20
like to complain about me &amp; my tactics,12
which are working,4
Just doing what I said I was going to do,12
If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria,17
which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President,15
they would be a national hero,9
ISIS is mostly gone,6
we’re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families,18
while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants.....,11
An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED,11
as has been reported by the media,11
Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides),44
Makes sense to me,4
President and Mrs,6
Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C,15
mansion/compound,5
I agree,3
totally necessary for their safety and security,16
The U.S,3
needs the same thing,4

“Absolutely nothing” (on Russian Collusion),12

2018 is being called “THE YEAR OF THE WORKER” by Steve Moore,19
co-author of “Trumponomics.” It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the “best job market in 50 years,33
and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers,21
Big wage gains.”,3
For those that naively ask why didn’t the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year,29
it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES,15
and they will gives us “NONE” for Border Security,13
Now we have to do it the hard way,9
with a Shutdown,4
Too bad,2
@FoxNews,3
children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol,22
The father of the young girl said it was not their fault,13
he hadn’t given her water in days,11
Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end,12
They are working so hard &amp; getting so little credit,15
Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally,59
They can’t,3
If we had a Wall,5
they wouldn’t even try,7

Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs,19
Go back to pre-NAFTA,6
before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico,23
Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border.....,14
The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA,22
over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount),28
that I would consider closing the Southern Border a “profit making operation.” We build a Wall or....,27
We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall &amp; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,60
Hard to believe there was a Congress &amp; President who would approve,18
CNN &amp; others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany,41
If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat,12
I will sign,3
Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported,23
This isn’t about the Wall,8
everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%),27

Build the Wall,3
“Border Patrol Agents want the Wall.” Democrat’s say they don’t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed),31
and they don’t want ICE,6
They don’t have much to campaign on,9
do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity,22
The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn’t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain,39
thereby setting up a Supreme Court case,10
After ruling,4
Dems dropped deal - and that’s where we are today,11
Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall,11
The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall,16
where they almost all recently agreed it should be built,14
is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting &amp; expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years,46

record,2

At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about,35
Crazy,2
Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria,28
instead of the United States,8
See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country,27
the U.S.,3
that is 5000 miles away,8
Thanks to Saudi A,5
The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security,22
The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand,20
The reporting has been inaccurate on the point,13
The problem is,4
without the Wall,4
much of the rest of Dollars are wasted,10
I never “lashed out” at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S.,19
a man for whom I have great respect,9
This is a made up story,7
one of many,4
by the Fake News Media,7
The only problem our economy has is the Fed,15
They don’t have a feel for the Market,10
they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders,28
The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt,24
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN,10
For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember,17
he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH &amp; sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker,65
We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world,28
while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S.,18
and our TAXPAYERS,6
on Trade,2
General Mattis did not see this as a problem,13
I DO,2
and it is being fixed,6
To those few Senators who think I don’t like or appreciate being allied with other countries,26
they are wrong,3
I DO,2
What I don’t like,5
however,3
is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States,23
both in Military Protection and Trade..,11
Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence,28
It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign,17
because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked,17
that they turned against it,6
Desperately needed,6
President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus,51

We signed two pieces of major legislation this week,14

I gave him a second chance,7

Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S,19

We fight for the borders of other countries,11
but we won’t fight for the borders of our own,13
The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall,36

There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia - Never,24
just look at the facts,5
The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture,14
Thank you @SteveDaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on DESPERATELY NEEDED Border Security,40
Have my total support,6
Mitch,1
use the Nuclear Option and get it done,11
Our Country is counting on you,9
Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall,19
or Fence,2
and was unable to do so,8
Others also have tried,6
We will get it done,5
one way or the other,6
Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security,18
House Republican Vote,6
217-185,14
The Democrats,4
whose votes we need in the Senate,8
will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED,29
If the Dems vote no,5
there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time,15
People don’t want Open Borders and Crime,11
No matter what happens today in the Senate,12
Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves,15
They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall,28
Not one Democrat voted yes,8
and we won big,4
I am very proud of you,7
on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall,17
Properly designed and built Walls work,9
and the Democrats are lying when they say they don’t,14
In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful,17
Will not be any different on our Southern Border,15
Hundreds of $Billions saved,8
The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall,17
calling it old fashioned,6
The fact is there is nothing else’s that will work,12
and that has been true for thousands of years,10
It’s like the wheel,5
there is nothing better,6
I know tech better than anyone,9
&amp; technology....,6
Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything,28
He will need Democrat votes,7
but as shown in the House,6
good things happen,4
If enough Dems don’t vote,7
it will be a Democrat Shutdown,9
House Republicans were great yesterday,10
Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said,11
last week live from the Oval Office,9
that the Republicans didn’t have the votes for Border Security,19
Today the House Republicans voted and won,12
217-185,14
Nancy does not have to apologize,10
All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY,11
Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall,29
The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before,43
So proud of you all,5
Now on to the Senate,6
General Jim Mattis will be retiring,11
with distinction,4
at the end of February,8
after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years,24
During Jim’s tenure,6
tremendous progress has been made,8
especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting...,14
equipment,3
General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations,34
A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly,14
I greatly thank Jim for his service,9
Democrats,3
it is time to come together and put the SAFETY of the AMERICAN PEOPLE before POLITICS,26
Border security must become a #1 priority,17
https://t.co/Wck6UpQGil,17
Farm Bill signing in 15 minutes,9
#Emmys #TBT https://t.co/KtSS17xvIn,30
So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives &amp; billions of $$$,30
Why are we fighting for our enemy,11
Syria,3
by staying &amp; killing ISIS for them,11
Russia,2
Iran &amp; other locals? Time to focus on our Country &amp; bring our youth back home where they belong,29
Congress just passed the Criminal Justice Reform Bill known as the #FirstStepAct,21
Congratulations,5
This is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody,16
When both parties work together we can keep our Country safer,17
A wonderful thing for the U.S.A.!,10
When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill,12
I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership,17
Would be done by end of year (NOW),8
It didn’t happen,6
We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A,27
Not good,2
With so much talk about the Wall,8
people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol,25
ICE and our great Military,9
Remember the Caravans? Well,8
they didn’t get through and none are forming or on their way,15
Border is tight,4
Fake News silent,4
The Democrats,4
who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security,17
are putting politics over Country,10
What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation,25
including infrastructure,7
unless it has perfect Border Security,12
U.S.A,3
WINS,1
Russia,2
Iran,2
Syria &amp; many others are not happy about the U.S,18
leaving,2
despite what the Fake News says,7
because now they will have to fight ISIS and others,13
who they hate,3
without us,3
I am building by far the most powerful military in the world,18
ISIS hits us they are doomed,7
Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East,17
getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who,22
in almost all cases,6
do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight....,29
Getting out of Syria was no surprise,11
I’ve been campaigning on it for years,10
and six months ago,5
when I very publicly wanted to do it,12
I agreed to stay longer,7
Russia,2
Iran,2
Syria &amp; others are the local enemy of ISIS,17
We were doing there work,6
Time to come home &amp; rebuild,8
#MAGA,4
“I’m proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria.” Senator Rand Paul,30
“I couldn’t agree more with the presidents decision,15
By definition,5
this is the opposite of an Obama decision,14
Senator Mike Lee,5
“Trump gets no credit for what he’s done in the Middle East.” @IngrahamAngle So true,23
thank you Laura,4
Col,1
Jim Carafano on @IngrahamAngle “Trump has made the Middle East a better place,23
When Trump came into office,7
ISIS was running amuck in the Middle East,12
Over a million refugees poured into Western Europe - none of that is happening today,24
That’s all due to Trump.”,6
After historic victories against ISIS,12
it’s time to bring our great young people home,12
https://t.co/xoNjFzQFTp,15
In any event,5
it goes on and on &amp; the new AG,10
who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda),26
does little else but rant,6
rave &amp; politic against me,9
Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of “justice.”,22
sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman,8
who has since resigned over horrific women abuse,14
when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics,22
Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton,13
and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation.....,16
The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money,18
both mine and others,5
to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees,15
rent,1
salaries etc,7
Now,1
as usual,4
I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by....,23
We have defeated ISIS in Syria,11
my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,17
Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA,19
the replacement for NAFTA,7
Far more money coming to the U.S,10
Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border,13
including large scale criminal and drug inflow,12
the United States Military will build the Wall,13
In our Country,5
so much money has been poured down the drain,10
for so many years,5
but when it comes to Border Security and the Military,17
the Democrats fight to the death,8
We won on the Military,8
which is being completely rebuilt,9
One way or the other,6
we will win on the Wall,6
In our Country,5
so much money has been poured down the drain,10
for so many years,5
but the Democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on Boarder Security (including a Wall) and the Military,35
We won on the Military,8
it is being completely rebuilt,9
We will win..,3
This will keep our communities safer,11
and provide hope and a second chance,9
to those who earn it,5
In addition to everything else,9
billions of dollars will be saved,8
I look forward to signing this into law,11
America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens,24
even those who have made mistakes,8
Congratulations to the Senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill...,30
The Democrats,4
are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall,27
we are building artistically designed steel slats,12
so that you can easily see through it...,10
It will be beautiful and,7
at the same time,4
give our Country the security that our citizens deserve,18
It will go up fast and save us BILLIONS of dollars a month once completed,19
Congratulations to @MarthaMcSally on her appointment by Governor @DougDucey as the Great new Senator from Arizona - I have no doubt she will do a fantastic job,48

but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?,26
WILL NEVER BE PROVEN AND ARE LIKELY FALSE.” Thank you to Michael Isikoff,19
Yahoo,2
for honesty,4
What this means is that the FISA WARRANTS and the whole Russian Witch Hunt is a Fraud and a Hoax which should be ended immediately,33
Also,2
it was paid for by Crooked Hillary &amp; DNC,15
Russia Dossier reporter now doubts dopey Christopher Steele’s claims,17
“When you get into the details of the Steele Dossier,13
the specific allegations,8
we have not seen the evidence to support them,12
There’s good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations....,19
Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year,24
How was this allowed to happen?,8
Facebook,2
Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous,19
Twitter,2
in fact,2
has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump,18
They have removed many names &amp; greatly slowed the level and speed of increase,20
They have acknowledged-done NOTHING,8
I hope the people over at the Fed will read today’s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake,34
Also,2
don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is,20
Stop with the 50 B’s,7
Feel the market,4
don’t just go by meaningless numbers,10
Good luck,2
Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,13
Will be interesting to see what he has to say,13
despite tremendous pressure being put on him,12
about Russian Collusion in our great and,12
obviously,4
highly successful political campaign,11
There was no Collusion,6
Biggest outrage yet in the long,8
winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover,40
Lisa Page,3
were purposely &amp; illegally deleted,13
Would have explained whole Hoax,6
which is now under protest,7
Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers &amp; Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations,38
I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments,29
Our economy is stronger than ever–we stand with our Farmers,19
Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall,26
write them off as just another politician following the party line,19
Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have,14
at the same time,4
far greater safety and control,8
It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation,23
the outside world blowing up around us,10
Paris is burning and China way down,10
the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike,18
Take the Victory,5

The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable,28
Hurts families badly,6
We have a chance,4
working with the Democrats,7
to deliver great HealthCare,7
A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans,23
The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax,6
started as the “insurance policy” long before I even got elected,20
is very bad for our Country,9
They are Entrapping people for misstatements,11
lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago,15
Nothing to do with Collusion,8
A Democrat Scam,5
a persecution of the President.” Daniel Henninger,15
The Wall Street Journal,5
Thank you,2
people are starting to see and understand what this Witch Hunt is all about,19
Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place,26
“It looks here as though General Flynn’s defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to Donald Trump without quite knowing what that crime might be,55
It stops looking like prosecution and more looking like.....,14
Required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of Rod Blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a Jerome Corsi,51
If that doesn’t tell you something about what has been going on in our Country,22
nothing will,3

The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now,39
Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years,23
However,3
if you don’t separate,7
FAR more people will come,6
Smugglers use the kids,5
Judge Ken Starr,3
former Solicitor Generel &amp; Independent Counsel,17

“there is no evidence or proof of collusion” &amp; further that “there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the President.” Thank you Judge,46
@FoxNews,3
At the request of many,7
I will be reviewing the case of a “U.S,12
"Military hero,” Major Matt Golsteyn",11
who is charged with murder,6
He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas,35
@PeteHegseth @FoxNews,7
Remember,3
Michael Cohen only became a “Rat” after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable &amp; unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started,46
They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY’S OFFICE,11
Why didn’t they break into the DNC to get the Server,17
or Crooked’s office?,6
So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page,30
his lover,3
Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean,13
What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward,26
Want them,2
A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage,12
hour by hour,5
of networks like NBC &amp; Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live,21
It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials,18
Should be tested in courts,6
can’t be legal? Only defame &amp; belittle,14
Collusion?,3
Wow,1
19000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover,14
Peter S of the FBI,8
in charge of the Russia Hoax,7
were just reported as being wiped clean and gone,12
Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News,16
Witch Hunt,2
The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard,12
run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who,12
like many others,5
never had a clue),5
is flat broke and out of business,8
Too bad,2
May it rest in peace,5
Never in the history of our Country has the “press” been more dishonest than it is today,25
Stories that should be good,6
are bad,2
Stories that should be bad,6
are horrible,4

like with the REAL story on Russia,9

seldom get reported,6
Too bad,2
The Trump Administration will be announcing the new Secretary of the Interior next week,26
Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke will be leaving the Administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years,45
Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation......,27
Wow,1
but not surprisingly,6
ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas,24
Great news for America,7
As I predicted all along,8
Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster,19
Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions,24
Mitch and Nancy,4
get it done,3
For the record,4
there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff,17
Mick M will do a GREAT job,7
I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,30
John will be staying until the end of the year,12
He is a GREAT PATRIOT and I want to personally thank him for his service,21
I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney,11
Director of the Office of Management &amp; Budget,15
will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff,10
replacing General John Kelly,9

Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration...,16

Congratulations to @RichardGrenell,11
our great Ambassador to Germany,11
for having the courage to take this horrible issue on,15
If it was a Conservative that said what “crazed” Mika Brzezinski stated on her show yesterday,25
using a certain horrible term,9
that person would be banned permanently from television...,15
WITCH HUNT,2
They gave General Flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the FBI said he didn’t lie and they overrode the FBI,42
They want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements,31
Sad!.....,1
guilty even on a civil basis,10
Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence,31
which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook,23
As a lawyer,4
Michael has great liability to me,11
guilty even on a civil bases,10
Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence,31
which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook,23
As a lawyer,4
Michael has great liability to me,11
stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws,17
if they even apply,6
because this was not campaign finance,9
Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me,16
but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not..,24
I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law,14
He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law,14
"It is called “advice of counsel,” and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made",25
That is why they get paid,6
Despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly.....,14
I often stated,5
“One way or the other,6
Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.” This has never changed,16
Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada),12
the USMCA,4
is so much better than the old,8
very costly &amp; anti-USA NAFTA deal,14
that just by the money we save,8
MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL,9
@FLOTUS Melania will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight on @FoxNews at 9:00pmE,30
The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing,28
but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?,21
Another very bad terror attack in France,12
We are going to strengthen our borders even more,14
Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security,21
Thanks to Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring a Senate vote on Criminal Justice this week,25
These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars,24
It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season,20
"“I don’t care what you think of the President...it cannot bleed over to the FBI...Comey is confirming there is bias in the FBI...” 
-Chris Swecker",41
James Comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow Democrats to take back the White House in 2020,36
In other words,4
he is and has been a Democrat,9
Comey had no right heading the FBI at any time,15
but especially after his mind exploded,11
Fake News has it purposely wrong,8
Many,2
over ten,3
are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position,16
Why wouldn’t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington,22
Please report news correctly,7
Thank you,2
Very productive conversations going on with China,15
Watch for some important announcements,9
Great job by Michael Anton on @foxandfriends,12
A true National Security expert,11
People do not yet realize how much of the Wall,13
including really effective renovation,12
has already been built,6
If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country,18
the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall,16
They know how important it is,8
I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer &amp; Nancy Pelosi,19
In 2006,6
Democrats voted for a Wall,8
and they were right to do so,7
Today,2
they no longer want Border Security,11
They will fight it at all cost,7
and Nancy must get votes for Speaker,9
But the Wall will get built..,6
however,3
for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left,19
do NOT want Border Security,9
They want Open Borders for anyone to come in,13
This brings large scale crime and disease,8
Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way......,16
Ice,1
Border Patrol and our Military have done a FANTASTIC job of securing our Southern Border,28
A Great Wall would be,5
however,3
a far easier &amp; less expensive solution,14
We have already built large new sections &amp; fully renovated others,20
making them like new,5
"The Democrats,....",4
Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country,19
people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls,16
makeshift Walls &amp; Fences,7
or Border Patrol Officers &amp; Military,14
They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries......,21
“Former FBI Director James Comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the Democrats paid for that phony Trump Dossier.” @LouDobbs Details on Tuesday night,49
James Comey’s behind closed doors testimony reveals that “there was not evidence of Campaign Collusion” with Russia when he left the FBI,37
In other words,4
the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started,15
which it was not (but even if it was,10
it is only a CIVIL CASE,8
like Obama’s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine,25
Lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake,14
not me),2
Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced,12
WITCH HUNT,2
“Democrats can’t find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey’s testimony,29
No Smocking Gun...No Collusion.” @FoxNews That’s because there was NO COLLUSION,21
So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction,14
"wrongly call it a campaign contribution,..",11
I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff,28
Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers,15
a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda,22
I will be making a decision soon,10
The Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other U.S,19
Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence,17
&amp; we are having a great time doing it,12
All of this despite the Fake News Media,11
which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the Enemy of the People,20
Leakin’ James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day,22
His Friday testimony was so untruthful,12
This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President,32
They are now exposed,5
On 245 occasions,11
former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn’t know,23
didn’t recall,5
or couldn’t remember things when asked,10
Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) - didn’t know who signed off and didn’t know Christopher Steele,31
All lies,2

Very sad day &amp; night in Paris,10
Maybe it’s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? The U.S,45
was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year,25
“This is collusion illusion,8
there is no smoking gun here,7

after all that we have gone through,8
after millions have been spent,7
we have no Russian Collusion,8
There is nothing impeachable here.” @GeraldoRivera Time for the Witch Hunt to END,23
I am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star General Mark Milley,20
Chief of Staff of the United States Army – as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,21
replacing General Joe Dunford,9
who will be retiring...,6
I am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our Country,22
Date of transition to be determined,10
AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30000000),26
NO COLLUSION,4
The idea of a European Military didn’t work out too well in W.W,28
I or 2,3
But the U.S,4
was there for you,4
and always will be,5
All we ask is that you pay your fair share of NATO,13
Germany is paying 1% while the U.S,13
pays 4.3% of a much larger GDP - to protect Europe,19
Fairness,2
The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris,17
Protests and riots all over France,9
People do not want to pay large sums of money,12
much to third world countries (that are questionably run),13
in order to maybe protect the environment,13
Chanting “We Want Trump!” Love France,7
Totally clears the President,8
Thank you,2
It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions,36
Total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration,23
Force him to answer the questions under oath,11
Hopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform,20
It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support,17
It will also help a lot of people,10
save taxpayer dollars,6
and keep our communities safe,9
Go for it Mitch,4
Mike Pompeo is doing a great job,10
I am very proud of him,7
His predecessor,5
Rex Tillerson,4
didn’t have the mental capacity needed,13
He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough,18
He was lazy as hell,6
Now it is a whole new ballgame,8
great spirit at State,5
and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country,20
he will be a great addition to our team,12
I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration,21
I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating The Honorable William P,22
Barr for the position of Attorney General of the United States,19
As the former AG for George H.W,11
Bush...,1
I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert,11
Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State,14
will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador,18
I want to congratulate Heather,9
and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country,20
We will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report,18
This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States,25
Today,2
we honor those who perished 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor,19
and we salute every veteran who served in World War II over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack,31
God Bless America,6

It has been incorrectly reported that Rudy Giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the Mueller Report,34
That is Fake News,4
Already 87 pages done,10
but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report,20
China talks are going very well,9
the lying and leaking by the people doing the Report,15
&amp; also Bruce Ohr (and his lovely wife Molly),13
Comey,2
Brennan,2
Clapper,2
&amp; all of the many fired people of the FBI,16
be listed in the Report? Will the corruption within the DNC &amp; Clinton Campaign be exposed?..And so much more,31
Foundation be listed at the top of the Report? Will the scathing document written about Lyin’ James Comey,29
by the man in charge of the case,8
Rod Rosenstein (who also signed the FISA Warrant),13
be a big part of the Report? Isn’t Rod therefore totally conflicted? Will all of...,23
overturned,3
9-0,3
in the United States Supreme Court,9
Doing same thing to people now,8
Will all of the substantial &amp; many contributions made by the 17 Angry Democrats to the Campaign of Crooked Hillary be listed in top of Report,44
Will the people that worked for the Clinton...,10
Will Robert Mueller’s big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his Republicans only Report,30
Will Andrew Weissman’s horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the Report,26
He wrongly destroyed people’s lives,9
took down great companies,6
only to be.......,4
Robert Mueller and Leakin’ Lyin’ James Comey are Best Friends,15
just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest,13
And bye the way,4
wasn’t the woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi (who I do not know) in charge of “legal” at the corrupt Clinton Foundation? A total Witch Hunt..,41
Arizona,4
together with our Military and Border Patrol,15
is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area,15
WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH,6
Big danger,3
Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall,16
FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE,10
Trish_Regan: “Did the FBI follow protocol to obtain the FISA warrant? I don’t think so,29
The Dossier was opposition research funded by opponents,16
Don’t use Government resources to take down political foes,17
Weaponizing Government for gain.” Is this really America? Witch Hunt,19
Jerome Corsi: ”This is not justice,9
this is not America,7
This is a political prosecution,11
The Special Prosecutor (Counsel),9
to get this plea deal,5
demanded I lie and violate the law,11
They’re the criminals.” He is not alone,11
17 Angry Dems,6
People forced to lie,5
Sad,1
@Trish_Regan,7
Statement from China: “The teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other,31
We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.” I agree,25
Does the Fake News Media ever mention the fact that Republicans,18
with the very important help of my campaign Rallies,14
WON THE UNITED STATES SENATE,8
53 to 47? All I hear is that the Open Border Dems won the House,22
Senate alone approves judges &amp; others,12
Big Republican Win,6
My thoughts and prayers are with the @USMC crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of Japan,31
Thank you to @USForcesJapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts,22
Whatever you need,5
we are here for you,5
@IIIMEF,4
Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt,9
and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax &amp; Regulation Cuts,24
Judge’s,2
Military,4
Vets,1
etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen,35
It’s called Presidential Harassment,10

the funeral service today of President Bush,13

@LouDobbs,3
Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is,13
not restricted,4
The World does not want to see,7
or need,2
higher oil prices,5
Looking forward to being with the Bush family,13
This is not a funeral,7
this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life,23
He will be missed,4
considered to be the worst and most dangerous,12
addictive and deadly substance of them all,11
Last year over 77000 people died from Fentanyl,18
"If China cracks down on this “horror drug,” using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers",25
the results will be incredible,9
One of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with President Xi of China is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly Fentanyl coming into the United States,52
It will now be considered a “controlled substance.” This could be a game changer on what is......,22
Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip,20
including stops,4
from Argentina,5
Not to sound naive or anything,9
but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting,30
ALL subjects discussed,5
China had agreed to start “immediately” buying U.S,16
products.” @business,5
“China officially echoed President Donald Trump’s optimism over bilateral trade talks,27
Chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of U.S,19
Soybeans &amp; Liquified Natural Gas,11
the first sign confirming the claims of President Donald Trump and the White House that.....,20
China does not want Tariffs,7
We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China,14
or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States,33
Ultimately,4
I believe,3
we will be making a deal - either now or into the future...,16
in the world,3
I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving America’s environment,28
But American taxpayers – and American workers – shouldn’t pay to clean up others countries’ pollution,29
I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago,34
The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters...,40
Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration,43
not including the terrible drug flow,10
Top Border Security,7
including a Wall,5
is $25 Billion,8
Pays for itself in two months,7
Get it done,3
But if a fair deal is able to be made with China,14
one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done,17
I will happily sign,6
Let the negotiations begin,9
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
I am a Tariff Man,6
When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation,18
I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so,14
It will always be the best way to max out our economic power,19
We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs,14
MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN,8
on seeing whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible,21
If it is,3
we will get it done,5
China is supposed to start buying Agricultural product and more immediately,23
President Xi and I want this deal to happen,12
and it probably will,6
"But if not remember,.....",6
The negotiations with China have already started,15
Unless extended,5
they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina,31
Bob Lighthizer will be working closely with Steve Mnuchin,15
Larry Kudlow,4
Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro....,9
Looking forward to being with the wonderful Bush family at Blair House today,21
The former First Lady will be coming over to the White House this morning to be given a tour of the Christmas decorations by Melania,38
The elegance &amp; precision of the last two days have been remarkable,20

Congratulations to newly inaugurated Mexican President @lopezobrador_,28
He had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the Mexican People,25
We will work well together for many years to come,13
Looking forward to being with the Bush Family to pay my respects to President George H.W,27
Bush,1
Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats,28
don’t want the truth,5
they only want lies,5
The truth is very bad for their mission,10
“I will never testify against Trump.” This statement was recently made by Roger Stone,22
essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about “President Trump.” Nice to know that some people still have “guts!”,47
his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free,15
He lied for this outcome and should,8
in my opinion,5
serve a full and complete sentence,8
“Michael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time.” You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE,22
unrelated to Trump,6
things having to do with fraud,7
big loans,2
Taxis,2
etc.,4
and not serve a long prison term? He makes up stories to get a GREAT &amp; ALREADY reduced deal for himself,28
and get....,2
We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall,22
Either way,3
people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally,17
We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary,16
Also,2
STOP THE DRUGS,3
I am certain that,5
at some time in the future,7
President Xi and I,6
together with President Putin of Russia,12
will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race,27
The U.S,3
spent 716 Billion Dollars this year,14
Crazy,2
President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship,19
He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change,24
on trade and far beyond,6
between our two great Nations,8
A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL,18
Farmers will be a a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China,24
They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately,20
We make the finest and cleanest product in the World,13
and that is what China wants,7
Farmers,2
I LOVE YOU,3
My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one,25
Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward,14
Very good things will happen,7
We are dealing from great strength,7
but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed,18
Level the field,4
China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S,25
Currently the tariff is 40%,11

out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H.W,21
Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference,19
I was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving Argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the G20...,59
President George H.W,8
Bush led a long,4
successful and beautiful life,8
Whenever I was with him I saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family,24
His accomplishments were great from beginning to end,13
He was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all,15

Oh,1
I get it,3
I am a very good developer,10
happily living my life,7
when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly),20
Against all odds,4
I decide to run for President &amp; continue to run my business-very legal &amp; very cool,28
talked about it on the campaign trail..,9
Arrived in Argentina with a very busy two days planned,16
Important meetings scheduled throughout,9
Our great Country is extremely well represented,14
Will be very productive,7
Alan Dershowitz: “These are not crimes,9
He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner,18
I don’t see any evidence of crimes.” This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately,28
Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side,16
Where is the IG REPORT?,6
“This demonstrates the Robert Mueller and his partisans have no evidence,19
not a whiff of collusion,7
between Trump and the Russians,7
Russian project legal,6
Trump Tower meeting (son Don),7
perfectly legal,5

With all of the new books coming out you can't forget two of the great originals written by @GreggJarrett and @JudgeJeanine Pirro,36
Their books both went to #1,8
Go get them now,4
the phony Witch Hunt is well explained,9
@DBongino’s new book,7
"""Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J",13
"Trump,"" is terrific",5
He's tough,2
he's smart,2
and he really gets it,6
His book is on sale now,6
I highly recommend,6
They have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas,20
This book is on sale now - a terrific read of a really interesting subject,21
@StephenMoore and Arthur Laffer,9
two very talented men,7

@SteveScalise has written an absolutely fascinating book (BACK IN THE GAME) on the world of D.C,28

and more,2
He has experienced so much,8
in a short period of time,8
Few people have had his bravery or courage,12
and he has come all the way back,8
A big power and great person,8
in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin,14
I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved,24
Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia,21
I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting...,27
Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A,18
because of the Tariffs being charged to China,12
and there is a long way to go,8
If companies don’t want to pay Tariffs,11
build in the U.S.A,6
Otherwise,3
lets just make our Country richer than ever before,14
When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt,14
one that has shattered so many innocent lives,12
ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40000000 (is that possible?),29
it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia,17
So Ridiculous,5
Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren’t even looking at the atrocious,42
and perhaps subversive,6
crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats,19
A total disgrace,5
General Motors is very counter to what other auto,16
and other,3
companies are doing,6
Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country,18
Auto companies are pouring into the U.S.,13
including BMW,8
which just announced a major new plant,9
The U.S.A,4
is booming,3
So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt,14
This total Hoax will be studied for years,10
Sebastian Gorka,5
a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House,22

Congratulations to Steel Dynamics,10

would not be closing their plants in Ohio,11
Michigan &amp; Maryland,8
Get smart Congress,4
Also,2
the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S,17
for decades,3
The President has great power on this issue - Because of the G.M,18
event,2
it is being studied now,7
The reason that the small truck business in the U.S,13
is such a go to favorite is that,10
for many years,4
Tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country,22
It is called the “chicken tax.” If we did that with cars coming in,16
many more cars would be built here....,8
While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way,25
at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts &amp; they will get relief,42
This is our Joseph McCarthy Era,11

The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace,11
They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don’t want to look at the DNC Server),36
but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED &amp; acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena,34
Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO,17
Mary Barra,4
for closing plants in Ohio,8
Michigan and Maryland,7
Nothing being closed in Mexico &amp; China,13
The U.S,3
saved General Motors,6
and this is the THANKS we get,7
We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies,15

for electric cars,5
General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) - don’t think that bet is going to pay off,35

terrible Gang of Angry Democrats,10
Look at their past,4
and look where they come from,6
The now $30000000 Witch Hunt continues and they’ve got nothing but ruined lives,23
Where is the Server? Let these terrible people go back to the Clinton Foundation and “Justice” Department,27
The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint,14
when in actuality he is the exact opposite,15
He is doing TREMENDOUS damage to our Criminal Justice System,19
where he is only looking at one side and not the other,15
Heroes will come of this,6
and it won’t be Mueller and his..,9
The Phony Witch Hunt continues,8
but Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side,18
not the other,4
Wait until it comes out how horribly &amp; viciously they are treating people,21
ruining lives for them refusing to lie,11
Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue...,13
starts today,3

or even come close to winning,8
hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met,17
saw or spoke to a Russian during this period? So many campaign workers,20
people inside from the beginning,9
ask me why they have not been called (they want to be),12
There was NO Collusion &amp; Mueller knows it,12
When Mueller does his final report,9
will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble,20
will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those “on the other side”(whatever happened to Podesta?),34
and will he be putting in statements from....,10
Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants,11
many of whom are stone cold criminals,10

So with Obama seperation is fine,11
but with Trump it’s not,6
Fake 60 Minutes,5
@60Minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration,40
In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are,27
but it was in 2014 during O years,14
Obama separated...,7

So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T),15
Add that,2
which is like a big Tax Cut,7
to our other good Economic news,11
Inflation down (are you listening Fed),10
Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border,27
or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S,34
No longer),3
Dems created this problem,7
No crossings,3
The large and violent French protests don’t take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection,59
Both of these topics must be remedied soon,11
I will be in Gulfport and Tupelo,10

we will CLOSE our Southern Border,9
There is no way that the United States will,11

put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore,17
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court,35
We only will allow those who come into our Country legally,18
Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain,17
No “Releasing” into the U.S..,9
I am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by @USTreasury Secretary @StevenMnuchin1,31
The FAKE NEWS likes to write stories to the contrary,13
quoting phony sources or jealous people,11
but they aren’t true,6
They never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story,19
Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support,23
@senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and @SenSchumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country,32
Already passed,4

Would be a major victory for ALL,10

finally,3
with a major Border Security package,12
which will include funding for the Wall,9
After 40 years of talk,7
it is finally time for action,9
Fix the Border,4
for once and for all,5
NOW,1
Our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the Border because of the Judicial Activism and Interference by the 9th Circuit,48
Nevertheless,4
they are working hard to make America a safer place,15
though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins,15

Happy Thanksgiving,5

They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe,17
Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB,19
If not there will be only bedlam,9
chaos,2
injury and death,5
We want the Constitution as written,10
Justice Roberts can say what he wants,9
but the 9th Circuit is a complete &amp; total disaster,18
It is out of control,6
has a horrible reputation,9
is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country,14
79%,6
&amp; is used to get an almost guaranteed result,14
Judges must not Legislate Security..,11
HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL,7
“It’s a mean &amp; nasty world out there,11

A big story today is that because I have pushed so hard and gotten Gasoline Prices so low,25
more people are driving and I have caused traffic jams throughout our Great Nation,20
Sorry everyone,5
Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?,24
“79% of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th Circuit.” @FoxNews A terrible,30
costly and dangerous disgrace,8
It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays,22
Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits,21
Too big,2
There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan,13
We will stop them,4
Catch and Detain,4
Judicial Activism,7
by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens,23
is putting our country in great danger,11
Not good,2
“Thank you to President Trump on the Border,11
No American President has ever done this before.” Hector Garza,19
National Border Patrol Council,9

and why are a vast number of those cases overturned,14
Please study the numbers,6
they are shocking,4
We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe,22
Very dangerous and unwise,8
Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts,8
"but you do indeed have “Obama judges,” and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country",38

Bin Laden being a prime example,10
Afghanistan being another,9
They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return,27
That’s ENDING,4
Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did,18
I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center,20
President Clinton famously missed his shot,11

Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy,24
Thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties,40
The WORLD is now watching closely,8
In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County,27
"which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a “number,” couldn’t do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory",50
Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him “back into play.” Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he’s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy,58
Rick Scott was up by 50000+ votes on Election Day,16
now they “found” many votes and he is only up 15000 votes,17
“The Broward Effect.” How come they never find Republican votes?,16
Jeff Flake(y) doesn’t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel,20
he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the “crime” of doing a terrible job,33
A weak and ineffective guy,8
As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer,16
Marc Elias,4
to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes,19
Don’t worry,4
Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD,17
You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia – but the Election was on Tuesday? Let’s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin,49

perhaps we will add some Republican votes,11

“Bill Nelson is kind of an empty figure in Washington,15
You never hear his name,6
he’s never in debates on key issues - he is just under the radar.” Chris Wallace on @FoxNews In other words,30
Nelson is a “stiff.”,5
Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday’s Election (or Early Voting),39
Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law,23
Thank you,2
REMEMBER FLORIDA: I have been President of the United States for almost two years,23
During that time Senator Bill Nelson didn’t call me once,16
Rick Scott called constantly requesting dollars plus for Florida,16
Did a GREAT job on hurricanes,8

@RonDeSantisFL will be a great Governor,12
VOTE!!!!!,1
@DebbieStabenow voted against Tax Cuts,12
great Healthcare,3
Supreme Court Justices and all of the many things the people of Michigan wanted and need,24
She is an automatic far left vote,10
controlled by her bosses,6
John James can be a truly great Senator,11
Dana Rohrabacher has been a great Congressman for his District and for the people of Cal,24
He works hard and is respected by all - he produces,14
Dems are desperate to replace Dana by spending vast sums to elect a super liberal who is weak on Crime and bad for our Military &amp; Vets,40
John James,2
running as a Republican for the Senate from Michigan,16
is a spectacular young star of the future,12

Rumor has it that Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana is paying for Facebook ads for his so-called opponent on the libertarian ticket,40
Donnelly is trying to steal the election? Isn’t that what Russia did!?,20
Arizona is such a Great State but it needs Border Security which @MarthaMcSally will provide,27

Yesterday in Pittsburgh I was really impressed with Congressman Keith Rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure),35
His sincere level of compassion,9
grief and sorrow for the events that took place was,12
in its own way,4
very inspiring,5
Vote for Keith,3
Harry Reid,3
when he was sane,4
agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship,11
https://t.co/ypiE1QWKag,18
Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship,32
something he knows nothing about,8
Our new Republican Majority will work on this,15
Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border,17
Republicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems,23
“Donald Trump has made good on his promises,11
and it drives Democrats Crazy!” Brad Blakeman @FoxNews,14
The World is using our laws to our detriment,14
They laugh at the Stupidity they see,10
Harry Reid was right in 1993,16
before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive Crime) “stuff.” Don’t forget the nasty term Anchor Babies,38
I will keep our Country safe,8
This case will be settled by the United States Supreme Court,15
So-called Birthright Citizenship,8
which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens,23
will be ended one way or the other,10
It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words “subject to the jurisdiction thereof.” Many legal scholars agree....,37
Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh,19
The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad &amp; solemn day,23
We were treated so warmly,7
Small protest was not seen by us,8

The Caravans are made up of some very tough fighters and people,17

I will be interviewed by Laura Ingraham tonight at 10:00 P.M,20
on @FoxNews,4
Check out tweets from last two days,7
I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People - but dishonest reporters use only the word “Media.” The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News,60
They get it,3
and fully understand,6
CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the “Media is the Enemy of the People.” Wrong,42
"I said that the “Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People,” a very big difference",25
When you give out false information - not good,11
Great job being done by Congressman Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania,17
Thank you Keith,3
In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee,62
said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country,15
Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border,29
Please go back,3
you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process,24
This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you,23
Had a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil,22
Jair Bolsonaro,5
who won his race by a substantial margin,11
We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade,21
Military and everything else,9
Excellent call,4
wished him congrats,4
of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony,26
Fake News Must End,4
There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate,18
and even fraudulent,6
reporting of the news,6
The Fake News Media,6
the true Enemy of the People,9
must stop the open &amp; obvious hostility &amp; report the news accurately &amp; fairly,28
That will do much to put out the flame..,9
The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans,19
Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country,28
Actually,4
it is their Fake &amp; Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand,26
Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer,7
who I have not seen in action before,10
be interviewed by @jaketapper,9
He comes off as a crazed &amp; stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon,26

Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings,12
It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose &amp; dominating through almost 7 innings,31
Rich Hill of Dodgers,5
and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked,13
4 run lead gone,4
Managers do it all the time,8
big mistake,3
All of America is in mourning over the mass murder of Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh,34
We pray for those who perished and their loved ones,11
and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries..,23
This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity,19
It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world,28
We must unite to conquer hate,8
As you know,3
earlier today there was a horrific shooting targeting and killing Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh,36
Pennsylvania,4
The shooter is in custody,8
and federal authorities have been dispatched to support state and local police..,21

Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought,19
Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been,22
and will be,3
with them all the way,5
I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America,26
Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh,11
Pennsylvania,4
Law enforcement on the scene,7
People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered,14
Looks like multiple fatalities,9

I will be speaking at the Young Black Leadership Summit in 15 minutes where I will address the investigation into the bomb packages,37
Republicans are doing so well in early voting,14
and at the polls,4
and now this “Bomb” stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics,22
Very unfortunate,6
what is going on,5
Republicans,4
go out and vote,4
Twitter has removed many people from my account and,14
more importantly,5
they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all,32
A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship,11
now it is a Blimp,5
Total Bias?,4
The United States has been spending Billions of Dollars a year on Illegal Immigration,24
This will not continue,6
Democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws,14
If not,2
we will be forced to play a much tougher hand,11
Funny how lowly rated CNN,10
and others,3
can criticize me at will,7
even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing,41
yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream,12
“it’s just not Presidential!”,8

Except that I rarely use a cellphone,10

I like Hard Lines,4
Just more made up Fake News,6
A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News,51
It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description,17
Mainstream Media must clean up its act,10
FAST,1
Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on @foxandfriends that the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border,46

think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws,27

Sadly,2
it looks like Mexico’s Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States,38

We have just begun,5
The Economy is soooo good,9
perhaps the best in our country’s history (remember,16
it’s the economy stupid!),9
that the Democrats are flailing &amp; lying like CRAZY,15
Phony books,3

Very dishonest people,7
“It is mostly anonymous sources in here,12
why should anyone trust you? General Mattis,12
General Kelly said it’s not true.” @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the Midterms,42

“Lanny Davis admits being anonymous source in CNN Report.” @BretBaier Oh well,25

Their relationship and bond remain very strong,12

“The FBI looked at less than 1%” of Crooked’s Emails,17

Additionally,5
because of our much tougher Trading stance with China,14
I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN Sanctions which are in place)..,35

I am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the Border into the United States ILLEGALLY,42
If there were no serious consequences,11
our country would be overrun with people trying to get in,17
and our system could not handle it,10
Fake News,2
of which there is soooo much (this time the very tired New Yorker) falsely reported that I was going to take the extraordinary step of denying Intelligence Briefings to President Obama,54
Never discussed or thought of,7
Even James Clapper has admonished John Brennan for having gone totally off the rails,22
Maybe Clapper is being nice to me so he doesn’t lose his Security Clearance for lying to Congress,29
A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders,10

No more delay,4
“Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn’t happen.” Darrell Issa,44
House Oversight,4
We can take out the word “apparently.” @FoxNews,13
Will Bruce Ohr,3
whose family received big money for helping to create the phony,18
dirty and discredited Dossier,9
ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions “Justice” Department? A total joke,19
Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance,14
it’s worth great prestige and big dollars,10
even board seats,4
and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan,18
It certainly isn’t because of the good job he did,15
He is a political “hack.”,8
I hope John Brennan,5
the worst CIA Director in our country’s history,17
brings a lawsuit,4
It will then be very easy to get all of his records,15
texts,1
emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did,16
but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt,13
He won’t sue,4
Where’s the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion,17
and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed),26
If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt,16
they scream Obstruction,5
looking for trouble,5
They are enjoying ruining people’s lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies,31
the firings,3
the deleted Emails and soooo much more,11
Mueller’s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election,16
They are a National Disgrace,8
Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel,34
only with my approval,7
for purposes of transparency,9
Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone...,24
Study the late Joseph McCarthy,9
because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby,27
Rigged Witch Hunt,3
Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times,23
They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward,19
From the day I announced,6
the Times has been Fake News,6
and with their disgusting new Board Member,10
it will only get worse,6
The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President,27
when in fact it is just the opposite - &amp; the two Fake reporters knew this,20
This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People,20
So bad for America,7
No Collusion and No Obstruction,9
except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats,13
All of the resignations and corruption,11
yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction,22
What about the Brennan,6
Comey,2
McCabe,2
Strzok lies to Congress,6
or Crooked’s Emails,6
and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close,24
So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST,20
Yet Mueller &amp; his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse,29
The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel,41
he must be a John Dean type “RAT.” But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn’t have to,27
I have nothing to hide.....,6
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn,10
and all other requested members of the White House Staff,14
to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel,13
In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents,20
Most transparent in history,8
No Collusion,4
No Obstruction,4

https://t.co/5kIR5EggBp,18

But in the end,4

we will get along with everyone,9
Too many voices are being destroyed,10
some good &amp; some bad,6
and that cannot be allowed to happen,10
Who is making the choices,7
because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made,19
Let everybody participate,9
good &amp; bad,4
and we will all just have to figure it out,11
Censorship is a very dangerous thing &amp; absolutely impossible to police,24
If you are weeding out Fake News,8
there is nothing so Fake as CNN &amp; MSNBC,16
&amp; yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed,16
I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt,12
or don’t watch at all.,6
Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices,27
Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration,15
we won’t let that happen,7
They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT,17
while at the same time doing nothing to others......,12

He doesn’t disclose it under Fed Regs,11
Using your Federal office for personal......,12
“Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed.” Charles Payne @FoxBusiness How much more does Mueller have to see? They have blinders on - RIGGED,61
https://t.co/TmICRUV9uo,18
I say Andrew’s was a bigger and more incompetent blunder,17
He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress,18
but his political career is over,11
Which is worse,3
Hightax Andrew Cuomo's statement,8
“WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,14
IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT” or Hillary Clinton’s “DEPLORABLES” statement..,19
"When a politician admits that “We’re not going to make America great again,” there doesn’t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him",39
This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo,16
with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris,21
Wow,1
Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America’s lack of greatness,32
I have already MADE America Great Again,13
just look at the markets,6
jobs,1
military- setting records,8
and we will do even better,8
Andrew “choked” badly,5
mistake,2

@foxandfriends,4
attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date,23
&amp; go to the Paris parade,9
celebrating the end of the War,9
on November 11th,9
Maybe we will do something next year in D.C,12
when the cost comes WAY DOWN,6
Now we can buy some more jet fighters,9
The local politicians who run Washington,12
D.C,2
(poorly) know a windfall when they see it,10
When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade,23
they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it,18
Never let someone hold you up,8
I will instead..,4
How does a politician,7
Cuomo,2
known for pushing people and businesses out of his state,14
not to mention having the highest taxes in the U.S.,15
survive making the statement,7
WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,14
IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT? Which section of the sentence is worse?,15
In speaking with some of the world’s top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the U.S,33
"“Stop quarterly reporting &amp; go to a six month system,” said one",18
That would allow greater flexibility &amp; save money,16
I have asked the SEC to study,8
released in 2017,10
If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office,19
it constitutes an intelligence breach......” Richard Burr (R-NC) Senate Intel Cmte Chair @LouDobbs,27
“Director Brennan’s recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power,30
If Director Brennan’s statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA,26
why didn’t he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment.....,21
“....An incredibly corrupt FBI &amp; DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election,29
Brennan has gone off the deep end,8
he’s disgraced and discredited himself,11
His conduct has been outrageous.” Chris Farrell,11
Judicial Watch,4
How can “Senator” Richard Blumenthal,10
who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam),58
pass judgement on anyone? Loser,9
@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: “How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?” Now that is a really good question,52
Then followed by “Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero...” So true,22
a total Fake,4
“Very concerned about Comey’s firing,11
"afraid they will be exposed,” said Bruce Ohr",10
DOJ’s Emails &amp; Notes show Bruce Ohr’s connection to (phony &amp; discredited) Trump Dossier,26
A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act,14
Rigged Witch Hunt,3
“While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets,16
he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch.” Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews @LouDobbs In other words,29
they were colluding with Russia,8
“The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department &amp; whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS).” Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok,46
This is too crazy to be believed,9
The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility,12
Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years,18
They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor,14
who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage,21
We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man,15
but we are cutting back on Turkey,9

There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS,21
The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants,17
but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS,9
pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people,19
HONESTY WINS,4
The Boston Globe,4
which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for 1.3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses &amp; investment),35
or 2.1 BILLION DOLLARS,8
was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR,10
Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press,16
PROVE IT,2
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY,14
It is very bad for our Great Country....BUT WE ARE WINNING,16
Our Economy is doing better than ever,14
Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before,18
companies earnings are higher than ever,11

with his 17 Angry Democrats,10
without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia,19
The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.” Thank you Lou,16
so true,2
Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn’t this so-called “probe” ended immediately? Why aren’t these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary?,50
Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud,14
as is the rigged investigation he started,12
There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia,13
and everybody,5
including the Democrats,7
know it,2
The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary,17
the Democrats and the DNC,9
“They were all in on it,6
clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn’t do.” Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends If we had a real Attorney General,37

The Dems are the ones who should be investigated.” Thank you Lou,16
so true,2
should be shut down,4
The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt,26
It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors.” Thank you Judicial Watch,22
I couldn’t have said it better myself,11
guy was corrupt and had anti-Trump animus,12
Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation,34
Instead,2
Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong,10
He used Strzok,4
he used the Clinton DNC Dossier...the whole thing...,13
Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch: “The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else,30
There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok &amp; his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI,45
We know this..,3
such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true Champion of Civil Rights - until she got fired,27

Just fired Agent Strzok,7
formerly of the FBI,8

It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone,22
Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally,18
The list of bad players in the FBI &amp; DOJ gets longer &amp; longer,21
Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt,14
will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax,10
No Collusion,4

While I know it’s “not presidential” to take on a lowlife like Omarosa,21

Collusion is very real with Russia,10
but only with Hillary and the Democrats,12
and we should demand a full investigation.” Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends Looking forward to the new IG Report,31
“Collusion with Russia was very real,10
Hillary Clinton and her team 100% colluded with the Russians,20
and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising material on DJT,36
We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through...,12
California wildfires are being magnified &amp; made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren’t allowing massive amount of readily available water to be properly utilized,57

military and just about everything else,12
Better numbers than Obama at this point,11
by far,2
We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave,24
but there might be a Red Wave,7
Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt - but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS,41
Why aren’t Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ? This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country,64
Fortunately,4
the facts are all coming out,7
and fast,2
Fake News reporting,5
a complete fabrication,7
that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son,15
Donald,2
had in Trump Tower,5
This was a meeting to get information on an opponent,16
totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere,19
I did not know about it,7
Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated,37
much by the Obama Administration,11
while at the same time reducing taxes for our people,15
At minimum,4
we will make much better Trade Deals for our country,13
Tariffs are working big time,7
Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S.,16
always to our detriment,8
I say,2
"as they come,Tax them",6
If they don’t want to be taxed,8
let them make or build the product in the U.S,12
In either event,5
it means jobs and great wealth....,6
The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it’s TRUE,27
I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People,22
They purposely cause great division &amp; distrust,13
They can also cause War,6
They are very dangerous &amp; sick,10
Danny O’Connor is a total puppet for Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters – Danny wants to raise your taxes,30

China,2
which is for the first time doing poorly against us,13
is spending a fortune on ads and P.R,11
trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs- because they are really hurting their economy,32
Likewise other countries,6
We are Winning,4
but must be strong,4
Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today,16
Only fools would disagree,7
We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and,14
if countries are still unwilling to negotiate,13
they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs,15
We win either way.....,5
Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry,20
Plants are opening all over the U.S.,11
Steelworkers are working again,8
and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury,14
Other countries use Tariffs against,9
but when we use them,5
foolish people scream,5
Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated,19
China market has dropped 27% in last 4months,16
and they are talking to us,7
Our market is stronger than ever,10
and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated,26
America First......,5

@foxandfriends is blowing away the competition in the morning ratings,20
Morning Joe is a dead show with very few people watching and sadly,18
Fake News CNN is also doing poorly,12
Too much hate and inaccurately reported stories - too predictable,19
Charles Koch of Koch Brothers,6
who claims to be giving away millions of dollars to politicians even though I know very few who have seen this (?),30
now makes the ridiculous statement that what President Trump is doing is unfair to “foreign workers.” He is correct,30

The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was,18
along with Comey,5
McCabe,2
Strzok and his lover,6
the lovely Lisa Page,6
used to begin the Witch Hunt,7
Disgraceful,3
Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan,10
Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders,22
He worked for me for a very short time,10
Why didn’t government tell me that he was under investigation,19
These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax,15
This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now,28
before it continues to stain our country any further,16
Bob Mueller is totally conflicted,10
and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA,26
remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated,19

A Government Shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and Prosperous America,25
I don’t care what the political ramifications are,16
our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades,28
and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown..,25

One of the reasons we need Great Border Security is that Mexico’s murder rate in 2017 increased by 27% to 31174 people killed,57

Catch &amp; Release Sanctuary Cities - go to Merit based Immigration,20
Protect ICE and Law Enforcement and,9
of course,2
keep building,3
but much faster,4
THE WALL,2
Also,2
why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems,12
some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary,11
others,2
including himself,5
have worked for Obama....And why isn’t Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity &amp; real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta,43
Dossier?,2
Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump,27
including the fact that we had a very nasty &amp; contentious business relationship,24
I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) &amp; Comey is his close friend.,28
There is No Collusion,6
The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt,8
headed now by 17 (increased from 13,12
including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats,16
was started by a fraudulent Dossier,10
paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC,13
Therefore,2
the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam,9
and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change,34
accurately,4
90% of media coverage of my Administration is negative,22
despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving,17
it’s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low,20
I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the..,22
dying newspaper industry,8
No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up,15
our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people,32
As an example,5
the failing New York Times..,6
When the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government,33
it truly puts the lives of many,9
not just journalists,5
at risk,2
Very unpatriotic,7
Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news..,21
I would be willing to “shut down” government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security,29
which includes the Wall,5
Must get rid of Lottery,7
Catch &amp; Release etc,9
and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT,17
We need great people coming into our Country,13
The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by $52 Billion and,41

“Enemy of the People.” Sad,8
Please understand,4
there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally,18
whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes,26

lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory,22
Two very good and talented men in a great race,13
but congratulations to Brian,9
Obviously the European Union,11
as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States,16
as represented by yours truly,9
love each other,4
https://t.co/42ImacgCN0,21
along quickly,4
European Union Nations will be open to the United States and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them,37
There was great warmth and feeling in the room - a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible,26
Great meeting on Trade today with @JunckerEU and representatives of the European Union,26
We have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs,22
no barriers and no subsidies,9
Work on documents has already started and the process is moving..,18
Thank you very much,5
working hard,3
https://t.co/cSzbFfq2NW,16
Sergio Marchionne,5
who passed away today,6
was one of the most brilliant &amp; successful car executives since the days of the legendary Henry Ford,29
It was a great honor for me to get to know Sergio as POTUS,17
he loved the car industry,7
and fought hard for it,5
He will be truly missed,6
This week,2
my Administration is hosting the first-ever #IRFMinisterial,21
The U.S,3
will continue to promote #ReligiousFreedom around the world,18
Nations that support religious freedom are far more free,14
prosperous &amp; peaceful,7
Great job,2
@VP,3
@SecPompeo,5
@IRF_Ambassador &amp; @StateDept,14
The United States and the European Union have a $1 TRILLION bilateral trade relationship – the largest economic relationship in the world,43
We want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all American and European citizens..,32

Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night,20
Wow,1
69-30,5
those are big numbers,5
Now go win against the open border,10
crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you,15
She is weak on Vets,5
the Military and the 2nd Amendment,12
Win,1
What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad,13
Is this a first,4
never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad,56
China is targeting our farmers,10
who they know I love &amp; respect,9
as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S,24
They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt,14
We were being nice - until now,8
China made $517 Billion on us last year,18
When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation,18
it will only take longer to make a deal,11
and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity,18
Negotiations are going really well,11
be cool,2
The end result will be worth it,8
Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs,31
I wonder,3
what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year,43
No weakness,3
“The Russia Hoax,4
The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton &amp; Frame Donald Trump” is a Hot Seller,23
already Number One,6
More importantly,5
it is a great book that everyone is talking about,14
It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly,10
Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett,9
So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn’t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune,24
This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People,21
Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved,14
much bigger,3
but not Sinclair,4
Disgraceful,3
The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade,26
I have an idea for them,8
Both the U.S,4
and the E.U,4
drop all Tariffs,4
Barriers and Subsidies,7
That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade,13
Hope they do it,4
we are ready - but they won’t,8
Today,2
it was my great honor to be in Kansas City,13
Missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make FREEDOM possible,20

Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me,18
they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats,13
They definitely don’t want Trump,9
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
Heading to Missouri to be with many of my great friends,15
VFW here we come,4
Our Country is doing GREAT,8
Best financial numbers on the Planet,10

Today is the day to vote for Brian Kemp,11
Will be great for Georgia,6
full Endorsement,4
https://t.co/yPND2bJ219,24
Tariffs are the greatest,6
Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal,26
or it gets hit with Tariffs,7
It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking,15
Remember,3
we are the “piggy bank” that’s being robbed,11
All will be Great,4
Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate,27

In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon,34
Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?,20
The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S,30
Supreme Court two months ago,7
Next up is the U.S,6
Post Office which they use,6
at a fraction of real cost,7
as their “delivery boy” for a BIG percentage of their packages...,18
A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months,15
Likewise,2
no Nuclear Tests,5
Japan is happy,5
all of Asia is happy,7
But the Fake News is saying,7
without ever asking me (always anonymous sources),15
that I am angry because it is not going fast enough,15
Wrong,1
very happy,4
When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin,23
and all that I gave up,6
remember,3
I gave up NOTHING,5
we merely talked about future benefits for both countries,15
Also,2
we got along very well,7
which is a good thing,5
except for the Corrupt Media,9
”Carter Page wasn’t a spy,8
wasn’t an agent of the Russians - he would have cooperated with the FBI,23
It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump.” Tom Fitton @JudicialWatch A disgrace to America,29
They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now,13
and the DOJ,3
FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account,15
Source #1 was the major source,9
Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it,18
Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team,16
Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump....,13
“It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team,53
This is a Clinton Campaign document,10
It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump...,13
So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier,21
that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC,17
that was knowingly &amp; falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt,41
Tom Fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 A.M,14
NOW,1
Judicial Watch,4
To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER,13
EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE,37
WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE &amp; DEATH,24
BE CAUTIOUS,3
So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election,18
Why didn’t he do something about it? Why didn’t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax,29
that’s why,3
and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!,13
Happy Birthday @SenatorDole,9
https://t.co/MiVoB7qC6A,21
I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it,30
So bad for our country,7
@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews “Source #1 was the (Fake) Dossier,17
Yes,1
the Dirty Dossier,5
paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump,13
and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump,20
Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign...” ILLEGAL,17
Andrew McCarthy - “I said this could never happen,13
This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff,20
not just the people who gave it,8
It is so bad it screams out at you.” On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt,24
Looking more &amp; more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC,48
Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie,15
Republicans must get tough now,8
An illegal Scam,5
Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents,34
As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of “Justice” and FBI misled the courts,40
Witch Hunt Rigged,3

He will be a GREAT Governor,8
No Collusion,4
No Obstruction - but that doesn’t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats,21
who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats,20
want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election,15
Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing,17
The Rigged Witch Hunt,4
headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added,19
one who worked directly for Obama W.H.),14
seems intent on damaging the Republican Party’s chances in the November Election,25
This Democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 Election never ends,18
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of,31
Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of &amp; perhaps illegal,30
The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong,16
The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can’t believe it,23
Isn’t it in contract that players must stand at attention,16
hand on heart? The $40000000 Commissioner must now make a stand,19
First time kneeling,4
out for game,3
Second time kneeling,5
out for season/no pay,7
I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin,26
In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy,12
If I was loud &amp; vicious,8
I would have been criticized for being too tough,12
Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites,17
So important,4
Should have been done years ago,7
https://t.co/TFIqsaZWBt,16
Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years,13
The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election,21
A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries,16
They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers,11
Canada charges 275% on Dairy,18
Farmers will WIN,4
The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well,19
Tightening now hurts all that we have done,10
The U.S,3
should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals,28
Debt coming due &amp; we are raising rates - Really?,13
China,2
the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower,28
while the U.S,4
is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge,31
As usual,4
not a level playing field..,7
My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri,34
Such a tragedy,5
such a great loss,4

Really big jobs meeting today at the White House,12
3 P.M,3
“Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES.” Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips,32
The Fake News wants no part of that narrative,11
Too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set,24
The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia,22
even a confrontation that could lead to war,12
They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I’ll probably have a good relationship with Putin,29
We are doing MUCH better than any other country,14
The Fake News Media is going Crazy,11
They make up stories without any backup,11
sources or proof,4
Many of the stories written about me,11
and the good people surrounding me,9
are total fiction,5
Problem is,3
when you complain you just give them more publicity,13
But I’ll complain anyway,8
The Democrats have a death wish,8
in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE,16
This should cost them heavily in the Midterms,11
Yesterday,3
the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE,17
Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs,19
Likewise to Pfizer,5
We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices,17

strong on the border and illegal immigration,13
He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment,22
I give him my full and total endorsement,11
3.4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory - far greater than ever anticipated,30
and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition,23
Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia,21
They would rather go to war than see this,10
It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome,9
“A lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.” @foxandfriends @kilmeade,55
Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress,30
My endorsement came appropriately late,11
but when it came the “flood gates” opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve,24

Russia has agreed to help with North Korea,12
where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along,20
There is no rush,4
the sanctions remain,5
Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process,20
While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph,16
with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace,21
the meeting with Russia may prove to be,10
in the long run,4
an even greater success,7
Many positive things will come out of that meeting.,13
So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki,28
Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting,21
We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match,23
Big results will come,5
“Prosperity is returning,8
Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate,20
now as the most effective president,10

The Democrats want to abolish ICE,10
which will mean more crime in our country,10
I want to give ICE a big cheer,8

The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before,19
Thank you @RandPaul,5
“The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed to think?”,31
While I had a great meeting with NATO,10
raising vast amounts of money,8
I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia,18
Sadly,2
it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy,18
I had a great meeting with NATO,9
They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future,27
only because of me,6
NATO was weak,4
but now it is strong again (bad for Russia),11
The media only says I was rude to leaders,13
never mentions the money,7
Thank you @RandPaul,5
you really get it,5
“The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what’s he supposed think?”,30

Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S,22
foolishness and stupidity and now,10
the Rigged Witch Hunt,4
President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election,22
so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling,18
he said it couldn’t happen,8
was no big deal,4
&amp; did NOTHING about it,8
When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok,19
Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations,39
both present &amp; future,7
We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media,24
NATO is now strong &amp; rich,8
Congratulations to France,7
who played extraordinary soccer,10
on winning the 2018 World Cup,12
Additionally,5
congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever,33
know how to do is resist and obstruct,10
This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country – but at some point,21
it will heal,3
over the years,4
I would return to criticism that it wasn’t good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition,31
Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems..,23
Heading to Helsinki,6
Finland – looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow,18
Unfortunately,5
no matter how well I do at the Summit,11
if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia..,31
There hasn’t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea,21
there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages,17
Who knows how it will all turn out in the end,11
but why isn’t the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts? Because it is FAKE NEWS,23
These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years,18
Why didn’t Obama do something about it? Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win,26
that’s why,3
Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration,13
but Fake News doesn’t want to report the truth,12

I got 306,7
They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage,13
Still hurting,3
So funny,3
I just checked out Fake News CNN,9
for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings),16
to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy),24
They didn’t,4
But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin,16
Fake News.....,2
The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration,27
not the Trump Administration,8
Why didn’t they do something about it,11
especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September,28
before the Election?,6
Where is the DNC Server,8
and why didn’t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?,17
The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration,27

Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia,22
Not acceptable,5
All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment,14

What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S,48

Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY,14
not by 2025,9

Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint,21
Pfizer is rolling back price hikes,8
so American patients don’t pay more,11
We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same,20
Great news for the American people,10
The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S,34
has a $151 Billion trade deficit),17
and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO,15
and nicely pay for it,6
Just doesn’t work,5
A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans,17
especially Hispanics,6
feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama,24
Many countries in NATO,7
which we are expected to defend,9
are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low),19
but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made,19
Will they reimburse the U.S.?,8

Pfizer &amp; others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason,21
They are merely taking advantage of the poor &amp; others unable to defend themselves,24
while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe &amp; elsewhere,25
We will respond,4
The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out,20

I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S,16
President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M,29
Europe far more than it does the U.S,10
By some accounts,4
the U.S,3
is paying for 90% of NATO,11
with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment,16
On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S.,32
with big Trade Barriers on U.S,9
goods,1
NO,1
The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country,20
This is not fair,4
nor is it acceptable,7
While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office,19
they must do much more,5
Germany is at 1%,8
the U.S,3
is at 4%,5
and NATO benefits......,6
They just didn't get it,6
but they do now,4

Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S.,22

Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship,18
during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation,14
to 2500 Iranians - including to government officials,21

In the meantime,4
no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months,14
All of Asia is thrilled,6
Only the Opposition Party,9
which includes the Fake News,6
is complaining,4
If not for me,4
we would now be at War with North Korea,11
How can the Democrats,6
who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime,11
do well in November,6
The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security,19
while the Democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement,34
When we have an “infestation” of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country,22
who do we send to get them out? ICE,9
They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country,31
Dems do not appreciate the great job they do,12
Nov,3
The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before,17
and that’s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country,26
In any event,5
they are coming along very well,9

but nobody ever asked,7
I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday,15
On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court,25
Crazy Maxine Waters,6
said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics,17
is rapidly becoming,7
together with Nancy Pelosi,9
the FACE of the Democrat Party,9
Her ranting and raving,6
even referring to herself as a wounded animal,15
will make people flee the Democrats,9
Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their “leadership” wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE,35
thereby declaring war on Law &amp; Order,12
These people will be voting for Republicans in November and,17
in many cases,5

You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements,28

Next it will be all police,7
Zero chance,3
It will never happen,6
The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE,15

“The most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S.,51
and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?” Judge Andrew Napolitano,21

who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime,12
well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres,15

Their employees and customers are already very angry at them,18

it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered,14
they quit,2
The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before,16

We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U,18
in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S,14
in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs,11
In the end it will all even out - and it won’t take very long,17
When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House,17
I chided them about tariffs in other countries,13
like India,4
being too high,4
Companies are now coming back to America,13
Harley must know that they won’t be able to sell back into U.S,18
without paying a big tax,7
We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers,38
workers and companies,6
We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint,17
They must play fair or they will pay tariffs,10
Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand,29
That was long before Tariffs were announced,10
Hence,1
they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse,14
Shows how unbalanced &amp; unfair trade is,11
but we will fix it....,5

We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency,20
Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA),10
perhaps in a near drunken state,8
claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller,16
the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt,16
knows? Isn’t this highly illegal,10
Is it being investigated?,9

Speaking at 7:00 P.M,9
If this is done,4
illegal immigration will be stopped in it’s tracks - and at very little,20
by comparison,5
cost,1
This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL,18
Hiring manythousands of judges,9
and going through a long and complicated legal process,15
is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional,14
People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S,22
illegally,4
Children brought back to their country.....,8
Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours,37
Actually,4
we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama,35
Fake News is working overtime,8
I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to),30
because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on,26
But you do have to ask why the DOJ &amp; FBI aren’t giving over requested documents?,27
The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies,19

House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember,24
it still has to pass in the Senate,9
and for that we need 10 Democrat votes,10

He called &amp; said “monster ratings.” Be a man Jimmy,14
The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country,36
remove those Barriers &amp; Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A,26
Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street,12
Our Immigration policy,9
laughed at all over the world,7
is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years,29
Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again,26
We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country,17
When somebody comes in,6
we must immediately,7
with no Judges or Court Cases,8
bring them back from where they came,7
Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order,23

Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November,37

Elect more Republicans in November and we will pass the finest,18
fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world,19
Right now we have the dumbest and the worst,10
Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing,10
Remember their motto,6
RESIST,2
Ours is PRODUCE,5
Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate,19
we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - &amp; the Dems are Obstructionists who won’t give votes for political reasons &amp; because they don’t care about Crime coming from Border,55
So we need to elect more R’s,9

At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly,18
too big a story,5
It’s the Democrats fault,7
they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation,20
They want open borders,6
which breeds horrible crime,6
Republicans want security,9
But I am working on something - it never ends,12
The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration,33
Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world,19
and the Dems will do anything not to change them &amp; to obstruct-want open borders which means crime,25

#CHANGETHELAWS Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration,37
Get it done,3
always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security,17
We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally,20
Of the 12000 children,7
10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip,19
and only 2000 are with their parents,11
many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions,24
Democrats are the problem,7
They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants,15
no matter how bad they may be,8
to pour into and infest our Country,11
like MS-13,4
They can’t win on their terrible policies,12
so they view them as potential voters,10
If you don’t have Borders,7
you don’t have a Country,7
Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted,29

If President Obama (who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have,59
the Fake News would have named him a national hero,13
It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime,25
Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration,27
Change the laws,3
CHANGE THE LAWS,3
Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country,26
Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border,18
It is historic,5
with some countries the most dangerous places in the world,14
Not going to happen in the U.S,10
We don’t want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us,22
The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition,36
Crime in Germany is way up,8
Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture,33
Why don’t the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs,40
including MS-13,6
coming into our country illegally?,12
“The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own,34
Peter Strzok,4
Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller,28
A really sick deal,5
isn’t it?,4
The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security &amp; Safety,34
Don’t wait until after the election because you are going to lose,19
Why was the FBI’s sick loser,10
Peter Strzok,4
working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry &amp; Conflicted Democrats,27
when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover,20
lawyer Lisa Page,5
that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt,14
Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media,21
They are not supposed to be doing that,10
and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News,13
they put their own spin on it - truth doesn’t matter to them,15
WITCH HUNT,2
There was no Russian Collusion,8
Oh,1
I see,2
there was no Russian Collusion,8
so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion,16
The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax,13
Too bad they didn’t look at Crooked Hillary like this,15
Double Standard,4
Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn’t paying them enough,24
I think a really long strike would be a great idea,14

They are so happy,5
Over here,3
in our country,5
some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win,18
even if it does save potentially millions &amp; millions of lives,18
Holding back the “war games” during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation,42
Also,2
quite provocative,5
Can start up immediately if talks break down,12
which I hope will not happen,7
Funny how the Fake News,6
in a coordinated effort with each other,13
likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I “met.” That’s because that’s all they have to disparage,29
We got so much for peace in the world,9
&amp; more is being added in finals,11
Even got our hostages/remains,11
Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: “This IG Report makes it clear,18

Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns,17
Didn’t know Manafort was the head of the Mob,13

illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed,26
and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News,17
Now that I am back from Singapore,9
where we had a great result with respect to North Korea,15
the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt,13
always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime,26
The Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers,17
People are starting to see what is being done,12
Results are speaking loudly,7
North Korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way,20
Congratulations to @KevinCramer on his huge win in North Dakota,20
We need Kevin in the Senate,8
and I strongly endorse him,7
Heidi voted NO on our Tax Cuts,10
and always will vote no when we need her,10
Kevin is strong on Crime &amp; Borders,10
big on Cutting Taxes,6
Congratulations to Danny Tarkanian on his big GOP primary win in Nevada,24
Danny worked hard an got a great result,10
Looking good in November,7
Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state,36
RV’s are not for her,7
People are really upset,7
so phony,3
Josh Hawley should win big,6
and has my full endorsement,7
So funny to watch the Fake News,8
especially NBC and CNN,10
They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea,15
500 days ago they would have “begged” for this deal-looked like war would break out,19
Our Country’s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools,24
Oil prices are too high,6
OPEC is at it again,7
Not good,2
The U.S.,3
together with Mexico and Canada,11
just got the World Cup,5
Congratulations - a great deal of hard work,11
We save a fortune by not doing war games,11
as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are,17
Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea,24
President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem,24
No longer - sleep well tonight,7
Just landed - a long trip,6
but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office,18
There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,15
Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience,22
North Korea has great potential for the future,13
Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia,24
Now he runs against a total stiff,9
Tim Kaine,2
who is weak on crime and borders,8
and wants to raise your taxes through the roof,10
Don’t underestimate Corey,9
a major chance of winning,7
realize the economy is the best it’s ever been with employment being at an all time high,27
and many companies pouring back into our country,15
Wake up Punchy,4
Robert De Niro,5
a very Low IQ individual,11
has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies,17
I watched him last night and truly believe he may be “punch-drunk.” I guess he doesn’t..,21
My political representatives didn’t want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate,56
and Sanford was so bad,6
I had to give it a shot,7
Congrats to Katie Arrington,8
A year ago the pundits &amp; talking heads,12
people that couldn’t do the job before,11
were begging for conciliation and peace - “please meet,13
don’t go to war.” Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un,21
the same haters shout out,6
“you shouldn’t meet,5
do not meet!”,3
The World has taken a big step back from potential Nuclear catastrophe,20
No more rocket launches,6
nuclear testing or research,8
The hostages are back home with their families,12
Thank you to Chairman Kim,6
our day together was historic,10
I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people,25
Our unprecedented meeting – the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea – proves that real change is possible,38
https://t.co/yF3iwD23YQ,20
There is no limit to what NoKo can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce &amp; engagement w/ the world,39
Chairman Kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security &amp; prosperity for his citizens,49

As I said earlier today: Anyone can make war,14
but only the most courageous can make peace,11
#SingaporeSummit,8
Heading back home from Singapore after a truly amazing visit,18
Great progress was made on the denuclearization of North Korea,19
Hostages are back home,6
will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families,19
no missiles shot,4
no research happening,6
sites closing..,3
Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA,19
He is MIA and nothing but trouble,10
He is better off in Argentina,10
I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC,16
a state I love,4
She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes,18
VOTE Katie,3
I strongly endorse Adam Laxalt for Governor of Nevada,17
Adam is smart,4
works hard,2
and knows how to win,5
He will be a great Governor,8
Also,2
will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime,14

He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center,12

Great News,2
The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S.,19
say the haters &amp; losers,8
We have our hostages,7
testing,2
research and all missle launches have stoped,10
and these pundits,4
who have called me wrong from the beginning,10
have nothing else they can say,7
We will be fine,4
Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election,15

and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years,14
Highest confidence ever,7
Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end,22
that doesn’t matter,6
We will all know soon whether or not a real deal,12
unlike those of the past,6
can happen,3
Thank you Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong,9
https://t.co/8MMYGuOj8Q,18
Sorry,2
we cannot let our friends,7
or enemies,4
take advantage of us on Trade anymore,11
We must put the American worker first,11
Great to be in Singapore,7
excitement in the air,6
Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO,17
while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP,14
Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss,24
and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade,10
Change is coming,4
And add to that the fact that the U.S,10
pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!),39
The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military,31
Why should I,3
as President of the United States,10
allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses,16
as they have for decades,6
while our Farmers,5
Workers &amp; Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America,28
$800 Billion Trade Deficit..,11
Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal,17
According to a Canada release,10
they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S,16
(guess they were bragging and got caught!),8
Minimum is 17B,8
Tax Dairy from us at 270%,15
Then Justin acts hurt when called out,8
PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that,42
“US Tariffs were kind of insulting” and he “will not be pushed around.” Very dishonest &amp; weak,25
Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy,23
Based on Justin’s false statements at his news conference,14
and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S,19
farmers,2
workers and companies,6
I have instructed our U.S,9
Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S,26
Market,2
…Create peace and great prosperity for his land,12
I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted,27
I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World,33
It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before..,35
The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers,29
workers and companies,6
While sending their product into our country tax free,14
We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades — and that is long enough,19
U.S.A,3
Trade,1
They fully understand where I am coming from,12
After many decades,6
fair and reciprocal Trade will happen,10
Just left the @G7 Summit in beautiful Canada,16
Great meetings and relationships with the six Country Leaders especially since they know I cannot allow them to apply large Tariffs and strong barriers to..,39

I am heading for Canada and the G-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States,37
From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization,23

Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries,20
If it doesn’t happen,7
we come out even better,7
Canada charges the U.S,8
a 270% tariff on Dairy Products,17
They didn’t tell you that,7
did they? Not fair to our farmers,9
Obama,3
Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea,15
and now weak on Crime,5
High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up,22
Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran,11
we don’t need his advice,7
Why isn’t the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U.S,47
Totally unfair to our farmers,10
workers &amp; companies,7
Take down your tariffs &amp; barriers or we will more than match you,17
Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant,13
bringing up the relationship that the U.S,12
and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our Farmers,47
killing our Agriculture,8
Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S,22
massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers,15
The EU trade surplus with the U.S,9
is $151 Billion,12
and Canada keeps our farmers and others out,13
Look forward to seeing them tomorrow,10

he’s a Flake,4
When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax,35
There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted,20
It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election,16

Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting,27

unlike the Democrats,6
have done nothing wrong,5
Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years,12
Mexico,3
Canada,3
China and others have treated them unfairly,12
By the time I finish trade talks,8

Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan,34
Bob Dole &amp; many others over the years),12
but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him,20
and he wouldn’t have been hired,9
As only one of two people left who could become President,16
why wouldn’t the FBI or Department of “Justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? Should have told me,58
Jesse Watters “The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House.” So true,24
When you’re almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade,17
you can’t lose a Trade War,7
The U.S,3
has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade,13
time to get smart,4
Why is it that the Wall Street Journal,9
though well meaning,4
never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S,21
by other countries,5
or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are,19
and will be,3
pouring into U.S,6
coffers?,2
The United States must,6
at long last,3
be treated fairly on Trade,7
If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods,12
and they charge us 25,7
50 or even 100 percent to sell ours,14
it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated,14

it is Stupid Trade,5

Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time,32
Highly restrictive on Trade,7
They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers,15

Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today,16
He was treated very unfairly by our government,15
Very good meetings with North Korea,10
Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia,19
The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative,17
but they know it is not true,7
The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people,26
Spies (Informants),4
into my campaign,5
Surveillance much?,4
Iger,2
where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people,23

How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie,18
yet no apology,6
Double Standard,4
RUSH LIMBAUGH “If the FBI was so concerned,12
and if they weren’t targeting Trump,10

Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr,35
Gee,1
he never called President Donald J,10
Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC,23
Maybe I just didn’t get the call?,10
"The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at “1000 people,” when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’",42
This is the way they demean and disparage,11

and never did,4
There are lots of really good lawyers in the country,13
he could have picked somebody else!” And I wish I did,13
chief law enforcement officer,8
and they told me later,6
‘oh by the way I’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office,29
I would be frustrated too...and that’s how I read that - Senator Sessions,19
why didn’t you tell me before I picked you....,12
Rep.Trey Gowdy,4
“I don’t think so,5
I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job,42
not afterward,4
If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country’s...,18
The Fake Mainstream Media has,8
from the time I announced I was running for President,14
run the most highly sophisticated &amp; dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics,31
No matter how well WE do,7
they find fault,3
But the forgotten men &amp; women WON,11
I’m President,5
Sorry,2
I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear,20
bad Trade Deals,3
VA Choice,2
the Economy,5
rebuilding the Military,8
and so much more,4
and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc,42
Why aren’t the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton,43
It’s a Rigged Witch Hunt,6
that’s why,3
Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration,16
The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt,28
will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections,12
especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls,18
There was no Collusion,6
except by the Democrats,7

They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad,16
but backfires,4
Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill,23

On June 5th.,5
vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX,14
a really good and highly competent man,11
He’ll Make California Great Again,10
A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance),23
This is too good to be true for Republicans...Remember,15
the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime,13
the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members...not good,20
Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny,25
They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served,14
They cared for their families more than anything in the world,15

Why didn’t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win,55
and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart,13
He was in charge,4
not me,2
and did nothing,4
Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself,32
I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day,32
Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this,9
It will happen,4
Why didn’t the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton,27
many crimes,3
much Collusion with Russia? Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC? Rigged Investigation,30
Fantastic to have 400000 GREAT MEN &amp; WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D.C,24

They love our Country,6
they love our Flag,5

https://t.co/2X0cKE4stx,23
When will the 13 Angry Democrats (&amp; those who worked for President O),20
reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? It’s been a long time now,21
Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems,30
Justice,2
FBI &amp; Russia?,7
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged,7
Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven’t been lost in decades,31
13 Angry Democrats,7
and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years,19
#SPYGATE &amp; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST,12
With Spies,2
or “Informants” as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not),25
all over my campaign,6
even from a very early date,9
why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the phony Russia problem?,33
"The Failing @nytimes quotes “a senior White House official,” who doesn’t exist",21
as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated,14
holding it on June 12 would be impossible,12
given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.” WRONG AGAIN,18
Use real people,4
not phony sources,5
Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe,19
there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to how to deal with North Korea...and if there was,31
it wouldn’t matter,6
The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning,14

We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which,25
if it does happen,5
will likely remain in Singapore on the same date,13
June 12th.,4
and,1
if necessary,5
will be extended beyond that date,9
but complain and obstruct,6
They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world,22
Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks,29
I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees,21
change of management and board,7
must purchase U.S,5
parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine,13
Dems do nothing...,4
Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States,66
Lost almost $800 Billion/year under “O”,15
Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job,37
The killings are at a record pace and tough police work,14
which Chicago will not allow,8
would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop,13

Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea,20
We will soon see where it will lead,8
hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace,15
Only time (and talent) will tell,8
Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea,27
Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs,15
saying that they are individuals &amp; must be nurtured,16
or asking to end your big Tax Cuts &amp; raise your taxes instead,17
Dems have lost touch,4
“Everyone knows there was a Spy,8
and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.” Mollie Hemingway,40
The Federalist Senior Editor But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story,25
Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign,20
by the people and party in absolute power,13
for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question,25
even with the expenditure of far more money,13
LOST,1
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy,41
as illegal as that may be,8
But what about an “Informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the Russian Hoax?,27
I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis,30

“Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign” No,18

and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before,27
What goes around,4
comes around,3
@foxandfriends “New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal,16
Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?” Even Clapper,15
worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head,10
who has the problem of lying a lot,10
used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities,16
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes,39
how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal..,30
Follow the money,5
The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia,23
because there was no Collusion,8
He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders,32
who got duped,3

Under our potential deal with China,11
they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce,28
The Wall Street Journal asks,6
“WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?” A very good question,16
they then used to start an investigation about Trump,14
It is that simple,5
This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle,13
This was a Political hit job,9
this was not an Intelligence Investigation,13
Brennan has disgraced himself,7
he’s worried about staying out of Jail.” Dan Bongino,15
top of the FBI,6
Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump,17
We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier...he knows about the Dossier,24
he denies knowledge of the Dossier,9
he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier,14
which...,1
“John Brennan is panicking,7
He has disgraced himself,6
he has disgraced the Country,7

He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American’s faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the...,42
China must continue to be strong &amp; tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made,27
The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in,25
I want this to happen,6
and North Korea to be VERY successful,12
but only after signing,7
On China,3
Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time,12
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years,44
I ask Senator Chuck Schumer,8
why didn’t President Obama &amp; the Democrats do something about Trade with China,25
including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING,21
With that being said,5
Chuck &amp; I have long agreed on this issue,12
Fair Trade,2
plus,1
with China will happen,6
I hereby demand,5
and will do so officially tomorrow,11
that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration,66
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the World,23
Oh’ great,2
and why hasn’t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested,17
like others,3
after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington,42
D.C.?,2
What ever happened to the Server,9
at the center of so much Corruption,10
that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes &amp; offices early in the morning,51
but were afraid to take the Server?,9
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World,22
they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party,33
Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse,11
missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier,10
in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33000 Emails,21
got $145000000 while Secretary of State,19
paid McCabes wife $700000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more,30
Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam,18
At what point does this soon to be $20000000 Witch Hunt,16
composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years,31
STOP,1
They have found no Collussion with Russia,10
No Obstruction,4
but they aren’t looking at the corruption..,12
Things are really getting ridiculous,10
The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long &amp; boring story indicating that the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia &amp; me so now they are looking at the rest of the World,66
If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign,26
that is a really big deal,7
Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also,24
Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers,19

School shooting in Texas,6
Early reports not looking good,8
God bless all,3
Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted,21
for political purposes,8
into my campaign for president,9
It took place very early on,8
and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a “hot” Fake News story,18
If true - all time biggest political scandal,12
Why isn’t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia,45
led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe’s wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton,40
Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants,12
or Illegal Immigrants,7
“Animals.” Wrong,4
They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories,13
"I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as “Animals,” a big difference - and so true",22
Fake News got it purposely wrong,8
as usual,4
“Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign,14
This has never been done before and by any means necessary,17
they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn’t commit.” David Asman @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett Really bad stuff,31
It was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center,25
There is nobody like them,7
https://t.co/fG5W1SwIHK,20
Tomorrow,3
the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill,9
which includes work requirements,7
We must support our Nation’s great farmers,12
Great talk with my friend President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week,21
He is doing such a good job for Argentina,13
I support his vision for transforming his country’s economy and unleashing its potential,26
Talking trade with the Vice Premier of the People’s Republic of China,19

Congratulations to our new CIA Director,15
Gina Haspel,4
https://t.co/n1xj9LSV9D,21
Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday,16
Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care,28
Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE – Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day,33
Despite the disgusting,6
illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt,10
we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S,21
history - by far,5
"Sorry to the Fake News Media and “Haters,” but that’s the way it is",19
Wow,1
word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI “SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.” Andrew McCarthy says,35
“There’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.” If so,26
this is bigger than Watergate,8

Congratulations America,9
we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction,36
The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money,34
Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA,24
She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately,23
We need her to keep our great country safe,11
#ConfirmGina,6
and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill,11
He’s also weak on borders and crime,10
Sadly,2
our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr,17
Lou Barletta will win,6
#MAGA,4
Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent,21
Bob Casey,3
has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time,19
He votes along the Nancy Pelosi,10
Elizabeth Warren lines,7
loves sanctuary cities,7
bad and expensive healthcare..,7
Today,2
it was my great honor to welcome President Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan to the @WhiteHouse,25
https://t.co/3EkHChjnYA,17
House votes today on Choice/MISSION Act,10
Who will stand with our Great Vets,8
caregivers,3
and Veterans Service Organizations? Must get Choice passed by Memorial Day,21
We have not seen China’s demands yet,10
which should be few in that previous U.S,11
Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating,16
China has seen our demands,8
There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe,18
the meetings..,3
haven’t even started yet,8
The U.S,3
has very little to give,7
because it has given so much over the years,12
China has much to give,6
The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China,31
Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal,19
Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China..,21
Congratulations to Deb Fischer,9
The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box,26
#MAGA,4
Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania,15
He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well - like they haven’t been represented in many years,31
Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy,11
he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,14

#PeaceOfficersMemorialDay https://t.co/agxulpPyag,26
Today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year – the day we pay tribute to the Law Enforcement Heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty,43
They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace,19
We stand with our police (HEROES) 100%,14
https://t.co/XDtYRUeOk1,18
Nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and VOTE for Deb Fischer today,19
https://t.co/bDHVaGv2FS,16
Can you believe that with all of the made up,11
unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media,13
together with the $10000000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion),20
I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year,11
Much of the Media may be corrupt,10
but the People truly get it,8
Trade negotiations are continuing with China,14
They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S.,19
for many years,4
Stay tuned,2
Our great First Lady is doing really well,12
Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days,12
Thank you for so much love and support,9
Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady,21
Melania,4
Successful procedure,6
she is in good spirits,6
Thank you to all of the well-wishers,9
The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible,44
With that being said,5
leakers are traitors and cowards,8
and we will find out who they are,8
ZTE,1
the large Chinese phone company,8
buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S,16
companies,3
This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi,37

Lead up to 9:00 A.M,8
(eastern) event has already begun,10
A great day for Israel,7
So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris,12
At some point countries will have to open their eyes &amp; see what is really going on,22
This kind of sickness &amp; hatred is not compatible with a loving,19
peaceful,2
&amp; successful country,7
Changes to our thought process on terror must be made,14
Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place,19
They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary,21
Now,1
that will not happen,5
China and the United States are working well together on trade,17
but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China,19
for so many years,5
that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries,17
But be cool,3
it will all work out,5
President Xi of China,7
and I,2
are working together to give massive Chinese phone company,16
ZTE,1
a way to get back into business,9
fast,1
Too many jobs in China lost,8
Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done,14
Happy Mother’s Day!!,6

The Senate should get funding done before the August break,14
or NOT GO HOME,4
Wall and Border Security should be included,13
Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations,18
worst in history,5
Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct,15
all they know how to do,6
STAY,1
Iran’s Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie,48
But not anymore,5
North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month,20
ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th,14
Thank you,2
a very smart and gracious gesture,9
Why doesn’t the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration’s Anti-Trust Division has been,28
and is,2
opposed to the AT&amp;T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial,24
Such a disgrace in reporting,8
Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem,25
Congratulations to all,7
The American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them,28
We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality,23
affordable medication they need and deserve,13
We will not rest until the job is done,10

Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured,12
Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal,17
even going at it with President Obama,13
&amp; then Voted AGAINST it,8
Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that,23
Same with Comey,4
Thought he was terrible until I fired him,12
On behalf of the American people,11

Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today,13
There is nobody even close to run the CIA,14
Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M,20
The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing),25
when in fact he was flying to North Korea,12
Fake News,2
so bad,2
Secretary Pompeo and his “guests” will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M,26
in the morning,4
I will be there to greet them,7
Very exciting,5
I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting,54
They seem to be in good health,7
Also,2
good meeting with Kim Jong Un,7
Date &amp; Place set,5
Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio,21
He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs,19
His Socialist opponent in November should not do well,15
a big failure in last job,7
Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country,27
"She represents an ever expanding group of very smart “thinkers,” and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country",41
The Fake News is working overtime,9
Just reported that,5
despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy &amp; all things else,23
91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake),18
Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?,25
The Republican Party had a great night,11
Tremendous voter energy and excitement,12
and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November,19
The Economy is sooo strong,8
and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes,19
why wouldn’t we win?,6
The Iran Deal is defective at its core,11
If we do nothing,5
we know what will happen,6
In just a short time,5
the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons...,29

you are hurting your country,7
I will be speaking to my friend,8
President Xi of China,7
this morning at 8:30,7
The primary topics will be Trade,9
where good things will happen,6
and North Korea,5
where relationships and trust are building,10
Gina Haspel,4
my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA,15
is being praised for the fact that she has been,11
and alway will be,5
TOUGH ON TERROR,4
This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone,17
The CIA wants her to lead them into America’s bright and glorious future,23
I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm,28
National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in,16
Another record broken: nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed,19
Let’s keep fighting this opioid epidemic,13
America,4
The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal,38
He was the one that created this MESS in the first place,14
Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections,28
which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late,28
Lisa Page,3
who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover,24
Peter S),3
and attorney Baker,6
are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess,28
Our Country has to get back to Business,11
Good luck to Ric Grenell,6
our new Ambassador to Germany,11
A great and talented guy,7
he will represent our Country well,10
“The Great Revolt” by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory,30
The Forgotten Men &amp; Women are forgotten no longer,16
The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest,63
The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility,16
House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion,13
Coordination or anything else with Russia,13
So now the Probe says OK,7
what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up,14
phony crime.There is no O,7
it’s called Fighting Back,6
My highly respected nominee for CIA Director,16
Gina Haspel,4
has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists,16
Think of that,3
in these very dangerous times,8
we have the most qualified person,9
a woman,3
who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror,15
Win Gina,3
To the great people of West Virginia we have,12
together,3
a really great chance to keep making a big difference,14

We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR,20
Illegal immigration must end,9
Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets,51
Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office,29
All of us here today are united by the same timeless values,17
We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator,18

despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair,22
Prior to its violation by Ms,10
Clifford and her attorney,7
this was a private agreement,8
Money from the campaign,6
or campaign contributions,7
played no roll in this transaction,8
very common among celebrities and people of wealth,15
In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms,27

"The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,.....",27
Mr,2

not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign,16
from which he entered into,7

or NDA,3
These agreements are....,5

A Rigged System - They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress,18
What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal “justice?” At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved,45
NEW BOOK - A MUST READ,5
“The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump” by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett,35

It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened,19
Witch Hunt,2
Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country,32
Very much like North Korea,8
this should have been fixed years ago,8
not now,2
Same with other countries and NAFTA...but it will all get done,15
Great Potential for USA,8
So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media,23
No questions on Collusion,7
Oh,1
I see...you have a made up,7
phony crime,3
Collusion,3
that never existed,6
and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information,22
Nice,1
The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc,20
There is great Energy and unending Stamina,13
both necessary to get things done,9
We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so,23
Fake News is going “bonkers!”,7
The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist),28
They are totally unhinged,7
and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying,32
Truly bad people,5
During Small Business Week,6
we celebrate the great,6
hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business,25
The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak &amp; ineffective U.S,29
immigration laws are,6
Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities,37
We need lawmakers who will put America First,13
I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits,41
I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts,15

The White House Correspondents’ Dinner is DEAD as we know it,15
This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for,26
FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night,20
Headline: “Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S,15
Pledges Not to Invade” - from the Failing New York Times,13
Also,2
will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May,10
The White House Correspondents’ Dinner was a failure last year,15
but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it,20
The filthy “comedian” totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance),31
Put Dinner to rest,5

There were no such findings,6
A horrible thing that we in D.C,10

Tester should lose race in Montana,9
Very dishonest and sick,7
Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight,16
Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State,15
Auto companies expanding at record pace,12
Big crowd tonight,4

“Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN” @foxandfriends FoxNews He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN,37
great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being,26
Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire,23
and now,2
for no reason whatsoever,8
his reputation has been shattered,9
Not fair,2
Tester,2
Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false,27
The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family,47
Tester should resign,5
The....,1
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia,25
As I have been saying all along,9
it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies,17

Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released,14
“No evidence” that the Trump Campaign “colluded,12
coordinated or conspired with Russia.” Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow,30
A total Witch Hunt,5
MUST END NOW,3
Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today,21
So much to discuss,5
so little time,4
It will be good for both of our great countries,12
Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff,41
Thank you also to Chance and Dr,9

they really get it (lowest Black &amp; Hispanic unemployment in history),21
Please do not forget the great help that my good friend,12
President Xi of China,7
has given to the United States,9
particularly at the Border of North Korea,14
Without him it would have been a much longer,11
tougher,2
process,2
So great to have Staff Sgt,7
Dan Nevins and the incredible WOUNDED WARRIORS with me in the White House yesterday,23
These are truly brave and special people,10
@foxandfriends,4
KOREAN WAR TO END,6
The United States,5
and all of its GREAT people,7
should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea,16
After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing,18
a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place,19
Good things are happening,6
but only time will tell,6
Is everybody believing what is going on,13
James Comey can’t define what a leak is,11
He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is,30
He lied all over the place to cover it up,12
He’s either very sick or very dumb,11
Remember sailor,5
The U.S,3
has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada &amp; Mexico for the 2026 World Cup,31
It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U.S,23
bid,1
Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)?,27
Loved being on @foxandfriends this morning,11
Great show,2
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00 A.M,17

on trade,2
@FLOTUS did a spectacular job hosting the President of France @EmmanuelMacron and his wife Brigitte,29
Every detail was done to perfection,11
The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful,12

Busy day planned,4
Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today,25
This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done...he will be GREAT,18
Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat,32

Here’s a great stat - since January 2017,17
the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million,18
The American people are finally back to work,14
Mexico,3
whose laws on immigration are very tough,11
must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S,17
We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement,16
Our Country cannot accept what is happening,13
Also,2
we must get Wall funding fast,7
Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided,29
I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country,34
It is a disgrace,5
We are the only Country in the World so naive,13
WALL,1
Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State,23
The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people,12
including the Ambassador to Germany,12
They are maxing out the time on approval process for all,15
never happened before,6
Need more Republicans,6
Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office,26
They keep us safe and are very cool about it,12

Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said,8
after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos,11
“you got to ask,4
what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There’s no there there.” Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought,45
Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn’t come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal,39
A complete Witch Hunt,5
"“I can die happy now with Trump Job performance,” stated Mary Matalin",19
“A great overall President,8
stunning!” Thank you Mary,6
We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea,14
maybe things will work out,6
and maybe they won’t - only time will tell....But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago,28
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea,35
and they have given up nothing,8
Wow,1
we haven’t given up anything &amp; they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World),28
site closure,3
&amp; no more testing,6
“GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton.” @FoxNews Good luck with that request,30
“At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.” Wall Street Journal,24
The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as “Mr,16
Magoo” and Rod Rosenstein as “Mr,10
Peepers.” This is “according to people with whom the president has spoken.” There are no such people and don’t know these characters...just more Fake &amp; Disgusting News to create ill will,47
James Comey’s Memos are Classified,10
I did not Declassify them,8
They belong to our Government,9
Therefore,2
he broke the law,4
Additionally,5
he totally made up many of the things he said I said,15
and he is already a proven liar and leaker,14
Where are Memos on Clinton,7
Lynch &amp; others?,5
Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson,23
His trials and tribulations were great,10
his life complex and controversial,9
Others have looked at this over the years,10
most thought it would be done,6
but yes,2
I am considering a Full Pardon,10
So funny,3
the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning,14
Now he R’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material,22
including Servers and Emails,8
Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush,21
First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects,19

non-existent “sources” and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael,18
a fine person with a wonderful family,12
Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked &amp; respected,26
Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble,16
even if...,3
it means lying or making up stories,10
Sorry,2
I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media,25
The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman,17
known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don’t speak to and have nothing to do with,21
are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will “flip.” They use...,31

"A message from Kim Jong Un: “North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.”
Also will “Shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.” Progress being made for all",69
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore,31
the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really,18
does everybody know what that means?,9
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats,16
This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI,30
the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails,29
North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site,23
This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress,17
Look forward to our Summit,8
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats,16
This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI,30
the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails,29
Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories),29
today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers,14
including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press,27
Make America Great Again,8
Looks like OPEC is at it again,9
With record amounts of Oil all over the place,12
including the fully loaded ships at sea,11
Oil prices are artificially Very High,12
No good and will not be accepted,9
Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote,43
Here’s a choice,4
They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially,14
Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts,17
So exciting,4
I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis,34
Maryland,3
Looking forward to being there,8
So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written),45
Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so,22
James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,23
Also,2
he leaked classified information,9
WOW,1
Will the Witch Hunt continue?,7
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe “under the bus.” Inspector General’s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them,34
Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?,12
Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States,27
making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed,24
We are doing a great job of law enforcement,12
but things such as this make safety in America difficult,16
My thoughts,2
prayers and condolences are with the families,12
friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today,28
Mike Pompeo is outstanding,8
First in his class at West Point,7
A top student at Harvard Law School,9
A success at whatever he has done,10
We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP,13
He will be a great Secretary of State,11
Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors,20
Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved,15
The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country,27
Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government,34
hence,1
the American People,7
They are “slow walking” all of my nominations - hundreds of people,17
At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals,13
@MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her,24
Great on the Military,7
Border Security and Crime,8
Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee,12
She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her,17

Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 National Guard Troops” to do nothing,26
The crime rate in California is high enough,12
and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown’s charade,21
We need border security and action,11
not words,2
Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies,47
California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities,27
putting all Americans at risk,9
Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan,12
who has just left Florida,7
Talked in depth about North Korea,9
Military and Trade,6

Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month,19
Slippery James Comey,6
the worst FBI Director in history,12
was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where,18
by the way,3
there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems),11
Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week,16
Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed,16
Details of Summit are being worked out now,11
Denuclearization will be a great thing for World,14
but also for North Korea,8
A sketch years later about a nonexistent man,13
A total con job,5
playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it),14
https://t.co/9Is7mHBFda,19
There is a Revolution going on in California,15
Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous,19
crime infested &amp; breeding concept,10
Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border,19
but the people of the State are not happy,11
Want Security &amp; Safety NOW,10
While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP,19
I don’t like the deal for the United States,12
Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work,19
Bilateral deals are far more efficient,11
profitable and better for OUR workers,12
Look how bad WTO is to U.S,8
Pastor Andrew Brunson,6
a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States,16
is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason,18
They call him a Spy,5

States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers,27
Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores,13
Today’s Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens,31
including aggravated felons,9
This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by...,16
Congress – House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society,39
Keep America Safe,6
Welcome Prime Minister Abe,7
https://t.co/538EYyfWDq,22
Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media,23
They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day,15
Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post,23
and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters),10
Much of the media is a Scam,9
Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan,14
a truly fine gentleman,7
Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border,31
He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border,21
The high crime rate will only get higher,10
Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started,14
So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill,17
Everyone is talking,6
really nice to see,5
I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan,24
Working on Trade and Military Security,13
Employment is up,5
Taxes are DOWN,4
Enjoy,2
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S,22
keeps raising interest rates,7
Not acceptable,5
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G),31
then based his decisions on her poll numbers,11
Disgruntled,3
he,1
McCabe,2
and the others,4
committed many crimes,6
Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll,12
much higher than President Obama at same point,13
With all of the phony stories and Fake News,11
it’s hard to believe,6
Thank you America,6
we are doing Great Things,6
Slippery James Comey,6
a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!),17
will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history,16
by far,2
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past,15
I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices,23
and even homes,4
are going to be raided with everything,11
including their phones and computers,9
taken,2
All lawyers are deflated and concerned,10
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty,13
I hardly even knew this guy,8
Just another of his many lies,9
His “memos” are self serving and FAKE,9
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out,13
with such precision,5
that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term “Mission Accomplished.” I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term,45
it should be brought back,5
Use often,3
Comey throws AG Lynch “under the bus!” Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat,43
or AG,2
in order to lay off Hillary,9
No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break),11
The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like,19
how come he gave up Classified Information (jail),13
why did he lie to Congress (jail),8
why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it),24
why the phony memos,6
McCabe’s $700000 &amp; more?,14
Unbelievably,5
James Comey states that Polls,6
where Crooked Hillary was leading,9
were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe,18
In other words,4
he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win,20
and he wanted a job,6
Slimeball,2
So proud of our great Military which will soon be,14
after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars,15
the finest that our Country has ever had,12
There won’t be anything,7
or anyone,4
even close,3
A perfectly executed strike last night,11
Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military,26
Could not have had a better result,9
Mission Accomplished,5
https://t.co/6VLQYAlcto,17
DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster,17
He LIED,2
LIED,1
LIED,1
McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!,16
No collusion,4
all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes,11
We are bringing back our factories,10
we are bringing back our jobs,8
and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA,18
https://t.co/grABSrYUBX,17
untruthful slime ball who was,7
as time has proven,5
a terrible Director of the FBI,12
His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case,13
and the events surrounding it,8
will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history,14
It was my great honor to fire James Comey,12
James Comey is a proven LEAKER &amp; LIAR,13
Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was,29
in fact,2
fired,2
He leaked CLASSIFIED information,9
for which he should be prosecuted,9
He lied to Congress under OATH,8
He is a weak and....,5
Tremendous pressure is building,8
like never before,5
for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities,19
Started the Wall in San Diego,9
where the people were pushing really hard to get it,13
They will soon be protected,7
Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres,24
Obama,3
We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP,23
and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations,16
Japan,2
who has hit us hard on trade for years,9
America’s greatest treasure is our people – and my Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK,28
We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity,20

He will be a great Secretary of State,11
Never said when an attack on Syria would take place,14
Could be very soon or not so soon at all,11
In any event,5
the United States,5
under my Administration,8
has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS,14
Where is our “Thank you America?”,10
California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border,28
Thank you Jerry,4
good move for the safety of our Country,11
If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December,15

We are with you Paul,5
Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake &amp; Corrupt Russia Investigation,24
headed up by the all Democrat loyalists,12
or people that worked for Obama,9
Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA &amp; Comey letter),24
No Collusion,4
so they go crazy,5
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been,18
and that includes the Cold War,7
There is no reason for this,7
Russia needs us to help with their economy,12
something that would be very easy to do,11
and we need all nations to work together,11
Stop the arms race?,4
Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria,18
Get ready Russia,5
because they will be coming,7

which takes tremendous time and focus,9
No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back),14

BAD,1
So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House,15
Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China,22
the coming North Korea meeting and,10
of course,2
the vicious gas attack in Syria,10
Feels great to have Bolton &amp; Larry K on board,13
I (we) are,3
The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story,14
It was political pundit Doug Schoen,10
not a Ukrainian businessman,9

I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia C story,25

The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border,45

criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased,13
Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC,20
which is a total joke,6
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic,26

DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act,16
and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon..,16

Democrats want No Borders,7
hence drugs and crime,4
Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation,15
use Nuclear Option if necessary,11
to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People,12
Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT,10
but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job,14
Act now Congress,4
our country is being stolen,9
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country,26
They must stop them at their Northern Border,10
which they can do because their border laws work,11
not allow them to pass through into our country,13
which has no effective border laws....,9
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA,18
They want in on the act,6
Mexico is doing very little,10
if not NOTHING,4
at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border,19
and then into the U.S,7
They laugh at our dumb immigration laws,11
They must stop the big drug and people flows,10
or I will stop their cash cow,7

not saying that anymore,7

both mentally and physically,9

Wow,1
watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?” He said strongly “never,44
no.” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends,12
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime,24
It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC,29
and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign,18

🇺🇸🇦🇺Press Conference: https://t.co/rKokJGRsgu https://t.co/PkJUw8x9jb",49
Our nation’s motto is IN GOD WE TRUST,12
This week,2
our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean,31
We will never forget the historic crowds,11
the voice,2
the energy,4
and the profound faith of Billy Graham,10
#CPAC2018 https://t.co/5GDh7Jonkv,28
We salute our great American flag,11
we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance,16
and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem,13
#CPAC2018 https://t.co/qGKW2xGjP0,29
After years of rebuilding OTHER nations,11
we are finally rebuilding OUR nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride,27
#CPAC2018 https://t.co/rD9oTU8iex,29
For those of you who are still interested,11
the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA,15
Not a lot of interest on this subject from them,13
My daughter,3
Ivanka,3
just arrived in South Korea,8
We cannot have a better,7
or smarter,3
person representing our country,10
CPAC Today,4
MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands,27
but these killers come back in from El Salvador,12
and through Mexico,5
like water,3
El Salvador just takes our money,10
and Mexico must help MORE with this problem,11
We need The Wall,4
“School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question.” @TuckerCarlson,29
Just like so much of CNN,8
Fake News,2
That’s why their ratings are so bad,9
MSNBC may be worse,7
Today,2
it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders,27
law enforcement officers,7
"and education officials.

There is nothing more important than protecting our children",24
They deserve to be safe,6
and we will deliver,6

#GoTeamUSA #Olympics https://t.co/3cUZwLVGua,28
Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A.M,18
to discuss School Safety,6
Next week it will be with our Nation’s Governors,14
It’s been many years of all talk,9
no action,3
We’ll get it done,5
What many people don’t understand,10
or don’t want to understand,8
is that Wayne,3
Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots,25
They love our Country and will do the right thing,12
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health,23
Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks,12
Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope,19
If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting,39
the sicko will NEVER attack that school,10
Cowards won’t go there...problem solved,9
Must be offensive,5
defense alone won’t work,7
History shows that a school shooting lasts,10
on average,4
3 minutes,3
It takes police &amp; first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime,26
Highly trained,3
gun adept,3
teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly,13
before police arrive,6
GREAT DETERRENT,4
immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions,23
Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this,21
Far more assets at much less cost than guards,10
A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people,12
ATTACKS WOULD END,4
I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN &amp; @NBC,25
What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best,43
20% of teachers,7
a lot,2
would now be able to,6
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students,19
teachers and families,6
So much love in the midst of so much pain,10
We must not let them down,6

it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders,28

Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration,24
right up to January 20th,11
why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions,48
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead,8
There was nobody like him,7
He will be missed by Christians and all religions,12
A very special man,6
Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration,24
right up to January 20th,11
why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Session,48
@CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat,21
we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks,12
So true,2
thank you,2
https://t.co/9TTXlfokYz,17
Bad ratings @CNN &amp; @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall,31
They probably knew it was Fake News but,10
because it was a rally against me,10
they pushed it hard anyway,7
Two really dishonest newscasters,9
but the public is wise,6
Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law,19

"they are ready to grow their businesses."" https://t.co/w9aw68UwOj",33
cameras running,5
Another False Accusation,8
Why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off,38
Only @FoxNews so reported...doesn’t fit the Mainstream Media narrative,22
A woman I don’t know and,8
to the best of my knowledge,7
never met,3
is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago,35
Never happened,4
Who would do this in a public space with live security.....,15
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama,13
just look at the facts,5
Total Fake News,4
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map,24
all the way to the Supreme Court,8
if necessary,5
Your Original was correct,8
Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes &amp; waste money,25
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event,19
Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House,18
You’ve come a long way Matt,7
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll,13
perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away,19
Actually,4
they want to raise you taxes,7
substantially,4
Also,2
they want to do nothing on DACA,9
R’s want to fix,5
The President Obama quote just before election,14
That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” When I easily won the Electoral College,39
the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems,19
“There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections,30
there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time,22
and so I’d invite Mr,8
Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” ....,12
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia,32
including Crimea,6
Syria and so much more,7
We are now starting to win again,9
"“The Faith of Donald Trump,” a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb",18

economy is looking very good,10
in my opinion,5
even better than anticipated,10
Companies are pouring back into our country,13
reversing the long term trend of leaving,10
The unemployment numbers are looking great,11
and Regulations &amp; Taxes have been massively Cut,15

@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah,24
He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch,19
and has my full support and endorsement,10
Obama was President up to,9
and beyond,3
the 2016 Election,10
So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?,16
Have a great,3
but very reflective,6
President’s Day,5
Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey,12
who at one point I knew very well,9
interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes,14
The questions were biased and slanted,9
the facts incorrect,5
Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others,21

for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse,14
Russian meddling etc,9
Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo,15
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot,23
Big gain over last 4 weeks,7
I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans,20
the Cuts the Dems want to take away,9
We need more Republicans,7
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN,12
https://t.co/rYsv90cnvs,19
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord,13
disruption and chaos within the U.S,11
then,1
with all of the Committee Hearings,9
Investigations and Party hatred,10
they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams,11
They are laughing their asses off in Moscow,11
Get smart America,6
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election,27
he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats,20
lead by their fearless leader,7
Crooked Hillary Clinton,7
lost the 2016 election,11
But wasn’t I a great candidate?,10
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election,15
I said “it may be Russia,7
or China or another country or group,11
or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did,43
Finally,3
Liddle’ Adam Schiff,5
the leakin’ monster of no control,9
is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election,30
He is finally right about something,10
Obama was President,7
knew of the threat,4
and did nothing,4
Thank you Adam,4
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress,40
the FBI or Justice called for an investigation,15
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H,53
the DNC and the Dems,7
Remember the Dirty Dossier,8
Uranium,4
Speeches,2
Emails and the Podesta Company,10
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter,26
This is not acceptable,7
They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion,27
Get back to the basics and make us all proud,11
Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem,13
why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House &amp; Senate during the Obama Administration,37
Because they didn’t want to,8
and now they just talk,5
"“I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal.”

Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads,16
Rob Goldman,3
https://t.co/XGC7ynZwYJ,18
Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014,29
long before my run for President,9
Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know,18
Deputy A.G,5
Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity,48
There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election,33
"“Charges Deal Don A Big Win,” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost",19
succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results.” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign,30
“She lost the old-fashioned way,7
by being a terrible candidate,10
Case closed.”,2
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County,21
Florida,3
Will never forget them,6

law enforcement,4
first responders &amp; medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage,33
https://t.co/3yJsrebZMG https://t.co/ti791dENTy,41
Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014,17
long before I announced that I would run for President,14
The results of the election were not impacted,13
The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion,12
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned,28
Republicans are still working hard,9
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered,35
Am also working with Congress on many fronts,12

lottery,3
continues deadly catch-and-release,9
and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants,16
Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement,17
and a vote FOR open borders,8
If Dems are actually serious about DACA,14
they should support the Grassley bill,8
The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe,20
@DHSgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in America.” It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals),41
doesn’t build the wall,6
expands chain migration,6
keeps the visa..,4
In times of tragedy,6
the bonds that sustain us are those of family,12
faith,1
community,4
and country,3
These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need,33
https://t.co/bu140nscez https://t.co/OoTXMCSexB,37
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA,28
they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready,30
willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA,21
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed,17
even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior,15
Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem,12
Must always report such instances to authorities,14
again and again,5
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott,8
We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting,22
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting,26
No child,2
teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school,20
Today,2
I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate,23
as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America’s depleted infrastructure,35

Negotiations on DACA have begun,11
Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal,20
Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally,12
after so many years,6
solve the DACA puzzle,6
This will be our last chance,7
there will never be another opportunity,13
March 5th,4
Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except,25
of course,2
the Democrats,4
After many years we have taken care of our Military,17
now we have to fix our roads,8
bridges,2
tunnels,2
airports and more,4

make deal Dems?,3
The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year,49

After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East,19
it is now time to start investing in OUR Country,14
Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD,39
This is a true tragedy,7
Rep,1
Lou Barletta,4
a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters,24
will make a FANTASTIC Senator,9
He is strong &amp; smart,6
loves Pennsylvania &amp; loves our Country,12
Voted for Tax Cuts,5
unlike Bob Casey,5
who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer,13
4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut &amp; Jobs Bill....and it will only get better,51
We are far ahead of schedule,8
So many positive things going on for the U.S.A,15
and the Fake News Media just doesn’t want to go there,15
Same negative stories over and over again,13
No wonder the People no longer trust the media,14
whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history,20
#MAGA,4
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe,24
modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border,19
ending chain migration,6
and canceling the visa lottery,10
Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans,19

My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers,13
their families,4
and everybody at the @WestervillePD,12
https://t.co/AoingY77Ky,22
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do,17
The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011,25
and they decided not to do anything about DACA,15
They only want to use it as a campaign issue,13
Vote Republican,5
agencies,3
not just the FBI &amp; DOJ,9
now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election,23
Comey had conversations with Donald Trump,11
which I don’t believe were accurate...he leaked information (corrupt).” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews,30
“My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier,45
it shows that he’s been victimized,9
He’s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of......,23
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation,18
Some are true and some are false,7
Some are old and some are new,7
There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone,19
Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?,13
According to the @nytimes,8
a Russian sold phony secrets on “Trump” to the U.S,14
Asking price was $10 million,9
brought down to $1 million to be paid over time,14
I hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here,20
It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP,12
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew,21
because of sources and methods (and more),10
would have to be heavily redacted,10
whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency,16
Told them to re-do and send back in proper form,12
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low,12
Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election,35
and beyond,3
This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military,15
but much waste in order to get Dem votes,10
Fortunately,4
DACA not included in this Bill,9
negotiations to start now,8
Without more Republicans in Congress,10
we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally,23
after many years of depletion,9
take care of our Military,9
Sadly,2
we needed some Dem votes for passage,9
Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election,18
Just signed Bill,3
Our Military will now be stronger than ever before,16
We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more,18
First time this has happened in a long time,10
Also means JOBS,4
JOBS,1

Wow,1

Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame,31

and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it,13
Watch here: https://t.co/VPMTnko7Ik https://t.co/4OaXXuj9Va,39
We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system,19
Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security,33
https://t.co/rP9Gtr2E5N,23
Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA,29
fully secures the border,7

they aren’t serious about DACA-they just want open borders,18

My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson,17
a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken,15
@Colts,2
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson,27
This is just one of many such preventable tragedies,15
We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border,12
and with illegal immigration,9
FAST,1
Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law,14
your paychecks are going way UP,8
your taxes are going way DOWN,8

Representative Devin Nunes,8
a man of tremendous courage and grit,10
may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure,30
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time,34
March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA,22
Make a deal,3
Little Adam Schiff,5
who is desperate to run for higher office,11
is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington,15
right up there with Comey,6
Warner,2
Brennan and Clapper,5
Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information,23
Must be stopped,3
Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth,13
Perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition,23
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working,40
Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care,21

My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina,27
Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they’ve done,19
a tool of anti-Trump political actors,12
This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasn’t straight with Congress,51
as it hid most of these facts from investigators.” Wall Street Journal,17
“The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became...,81
Great jobs numbers and finally,8
after many years,5
rising wages- and nobody even talks about them,14
Only Russia,4
Russia,2
Russia,2
despite the fact that,5
after a year of looking,7
there is No Collusion,6
This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe,12
But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on,10
Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because,19
after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING,15
collusion is dead),5
This is an American disgrace,9
Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%,20
a far better number than I had in winning the Election,16

I have offered DACA a wonderful deal,11
including a doubling in the number of recipients &amp; a twelve year pathway to citizenship,28

Can’t let that happen,6
#AMERICA FIRST,7
For those asking,4
the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate,16
and they need 60,5
That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election,22
We can then be even tougher on Crime (and Border),13
and even better to our Military &amp; Veterans,17
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present,30
#DemocratShutdown,7
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border,39
They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead,22
#WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess,18
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety &amp; Security on the very dangerous Southern Border,32

The Wall will be paid for,6
directly or indirectly,8
or through longer term reimbursement,9
by Mexico,4
which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S,24
The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S,25

it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it,17

Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration,31
Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky,15
I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President,27
Now I have to put up with a Fake Book,10
written by a totally discredited author,13
Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well,14
So will I,3

my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being,17

Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and,16

I went from VERY successful businessman,11

Now that Russian collusion,7
after one year of intense study,9

the Democrats and their lapdogs,8
the Fake News Mainstream Media,8
are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence....,26

Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration,31
The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years,16
They are hungry for food &amp; for freedom,11
Along with human rights,6
the wealth of Iran is being looted,10
TIME FOR CHANGE,3
The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years,32
and they have given us nothing but lies &amp; deceit,14
thinking of our leaders as fools,9
They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan,17

Why is the United States Post Office,10
which is losing many billions of dollars a year,13
while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages,20

2009,5
which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage &amp; Russia hoax,26

Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total),23
These are fans who demand respect for our Flag,12

Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year,26
with deductibles very high,8
Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods,11
Sad,1
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill,17

Will be leaving for Missouri soon for a speech on tax cuts and tax reform - so badly needed,24
After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines,24
it makes me wonder,5
WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA,11
"After witnessing first hand the horror &amp; devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey,my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas",39
The U.S,3
has been talking to North Korea,9
and paying them extortion money,9
for 25 years,5
Talking is not the answer,7
@foxandfriends We are not looking to fill all of those positions,17
Don't need many of them - reduce size of government,13
@IngrahamAngle,6
Leaving now for Texas,6
HISTORIC rainfall in Houston,8

Spirit of the people is incredible.Thanks,12
Major rescue operations underway,11
Going to a Cabinet Meeting (tele-conference) at 11:00 A.M,22
on #Harvey,5
Even experts have said they've never seen one like this,13
"We are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico &amp; Canada.Both being very difficult,may have to terminate?",43
With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world,17
we must have THE WALL,5
Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other,15
Wow - Now experts are calling #Harvey a once in 500 year flood,19
We have an all out effort going,9
and going well,4
I will also be going to a wonderful state,13
Missouri,3
that I won by a lot in '16,9
Dem C.M,3

I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption,23
The focus must be life and safety,9

Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time &amp; very dangerous low,22
You can thank Congress,5
the same people that can't even give us HCare,12
I am continuing to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations,22
Much work left to do but effect will be great,11
Business &amp; jobs will grow,7
Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels,23
Stock Market at an all-time high,8
That doesn't just happen,6
I love the White House,5
one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen,15
But Fake News said I called it a dump - TOTALLY UNTRUE,14
I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S,22

best economic numbers in years,9
unemployment lowest in 17 years,11
wages raising,4
border secure,4
S.C.: No WH chaos,5
If ObamaCare is hurting people,10
&amp; it is,4
why shouldn't it hurt the insurance companies &amp; why should Congress not be paying what public pays?,26
Don't give up Republican Senators,10
the World is watching: Repeal &amp; Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option),21
get Cross State Lines &amp; more,7
they do NOTHING for us with North Korea,11
just talk,2
We will no longer allow this to continue,12
China could easily solve this problem,10
I am very disappointed in China,11
Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade,25

If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly,12
BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon,23
"After seven years of ""talking"" Repeal &amp; Replace",14
the people of our great country are still being forced to live with imploding ObamaCare,24
If the Senate Democrats ever got the chance,12
they would switch to a 51 majority vote in first minute,17
They are laughing at R's,6
MAKE CHANGE,2
8 Dems totally control the U.S,10
Senate,2
Many great Republican bills will never pass,12
like Kate's Law and complete Healthcare,8
Get smart,2
Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW,27
They look like fools and are just wasting time.....,10
The very outdated filibuster rule must go,13
Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate,15
Mitch M,2
go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN,9
IT'S TIME,2
Republican Senate must get rid of 60 vote NOW,14
It is killing the R Party,8
allows 8 Dems to control country,9
200 Bills sit in Senate,8
A JOKE,2
In other words,4
Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election - and why not,20

So many great future bills &amp; budgets need 60 votes...,15
If Republicans are going to pass great future legislation in the Senate,21
they must immediately go to a 51 vote majority,18
not senseless 60..,8
3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down,21

Very impressive people,7
I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss,37
I would have done even better in the election,13
if that is possible,6
if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently,18
Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult &amp; sophisticated than the popular vote,31
Hillary focused on the wrong states,9

called me about getting together for a meeting,13
We met,2
HE IS A GREAT GUY,5

Thank you to all of my great supporters,10

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words,32
Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam,14
as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees,19
is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country,13

Pathetic,3
Our not very bright Vice President,10
Joe Biden,3
"just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy",15
Sorry Joe,3
that was Ted Cruz,4
Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about,31
The danger is massive,6
NO,1
Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally,34
Get tough,2
The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country,33
No recognition - SAD,6
"Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said ""Trump is a genius."" America 1st",40

Funny,2
if you listen to @FoxNews,8
the Democrats did not have a good day,10
If you listen to the other two,9
they are fawning,4
What a difference,5
Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton,17
All of that work,4
energy and money,6
and nothing to show for it,7
Waste of time,3
Elizabeth Warren,6
often referred to as Pocahontas,10
just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary,19
who she always hated,6
Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution,15
We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs,21
If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party,17
they have no future,5
I know more about Cory than he knows about himself,14
I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing,14
He asked if he could have pictures taken with me,12
I said fine,3
He then trashes on air,6
Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold,16
He got NOTHING for all of the time,9
energy and money,6
The V.P,3
a joke,2
While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people,17
we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers,18
Clinton betrayed Bernie voters,8

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE,36
Wow,1
the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess,20
But fear not,3
the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn,13
Here we go again with another Clinton scandal,13
and e-mails yet (can you believe),8
Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in,10
B never had a chance,6
"Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her ""servant"" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught",27
that's all,2
They laughed at Bernie,5
If Bernie Sanders,5
after seeing the just released e-mails,10
continues to look exhausted and done,10
then his legacy will never be the same,11
Thank you,2
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam,25
Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened,33
How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails,26
using even religion,7
against Bernie,4
The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails,19
which should never have been written (stupid),10
because Putin likes me,6
Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes,16
No way they are going to fix America's problems,14
ISIS &amp; all others laughing,9
The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good,19
but for the final night,6
my speech,2
great,1
Thank you,2
The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that,16
after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory,19
she's out,2
The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing,26
E-mails say the rigged system is alive &amp; well,13
Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength,16
I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook,19
Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top,29
DWS,1
Too bad Bernie flamed out,6
If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails,15
resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player,15
(Bernie),2
media would go wild,6
The @CNN panels are so one sided,12
almost all against Trump,6
@FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher,16
Don't watch CNN,5
I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated,16
The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted,16
no energy left,5
Today proves what I have always known,9
that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one,13
not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.),11
Sorry folks,3
but Bernie Sanders is exhausted,9
just can't go on any longer,8
He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect,18
SAD,1
"There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end",40
An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates,34
Looks like the Bernie people will fight,9
If not,2
their BLOOD,2
SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time,10
Kaine stands for opposite,6
Wow,1
President Obama's brother,8
Malik,2
just announced that he is voting for me,10
Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else,18
Bernie Sanders started off strong,8
but with the selection of Kaine for V.P.,11
is ending really weak,6
So much for a movement,6
TOTAL DISRESPECT,5
The Crooked Hillary V.P,8
choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters,20
Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H,11

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night,20
From the heart,3
The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her,31
unless he is a fraud,6
Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together,13
ISIS and our other enemies are drooling,13
They don't look presidential to me,9
I will bring jobs back and get wages up,10
People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years,16
Clinton killed jobs,4
Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved,25
Job killer,3
Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs,29
I will bring jobs back,5
Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania,22
Against steelworkers and miners,8
Husband signed NAFTA,5
Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders,16
Mock his heritage and much more,8
On-line from Wikileakes,6
really vicious,4
RIGGED,1
Pocahontas wanted V.P,8
slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate,20
Also,2
Crooked Hillary hates her,7
Tim Kaine is,3
and always has been,5
owned by the banks,4
Bernie supporters are outraged,8
was their last choice,4
Bernie fought for nothing,6
The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine,18
who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for,14
Philly fight?,3
I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn,21
How to defeat radical Islam,9
Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?,36
Another attack,5
this time in Germany,6
Many killed,3
God bless the people of Munich,8

Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd,18

Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night,12
Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him,20
Typical politician - can't make a deal work,12
Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses,38
Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one,36
Shows weakness,3
Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate,20

that is before she found out the episode was on tape?,14
Wow,1
Corey Lewandowski,6

was just charged with assaulting a reporter,11
Look at tapes-nothing there,6
How come the @TODAYshow &amp; @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?,40
I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich,16
and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC,23
Wow,1
@CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows,15

I have already beaten you in all debates,12

so now he wants to debate again,9

I have won all debates,6
After the way I beat Gov,7
Scott Walker (and Jeb,5
Rand,1

Remember,3
I am the only candidate who is self-funding,13
While I am given little credit for this by the voters,15
I am not bought like others,7
Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls,8
they are just another phony hit job on me,12
I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election,19
Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U.S.,21
jobs are leaving,4

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq.were caused by me,27

when they know that it is just the opposite,11

which is a total disaster since the great Barbara Walters left,17
ever got their jobs,5
@abc is wasting time,8
@TheView T.V,5
show,1

is constantly asking me to go on,10
"I TELL THEM ""NO""",4
Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years,21

I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST,5
It is amazing how often I am right,11
only to be criticized by the media,12
Illegal immigration,7
take the oil,3
build the wall,3
Muslims,2
NATO,2
"Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a ""hell hole"" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article",34
I was so right,4
These politicians like Cruz and Graham,10
who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years,17
do nothing to make things better,8
@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION,29
Both talk about ISIS,6
do nothing,3
It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V,18
shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run,23
We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O,17
Why? It is time to renegotiate,10
and the time is now,5
N.A.T.O,4
is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on,36
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win,25
Could not have done it without you Joe,9
While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates,29
it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race,15
I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted,12
Jeb spent more than $150000000 and got nothing,18
I spent a fraction of that and am first,10
I will be the best by far in fighting terror,12
I’m the only one that was right from the beginning,14
&amp; now Lyin’ Ted &amp; others are copying me,15
Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror,16
She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are,19
Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates,15
Lyin’ Ted Cruz,4
Honestly,3
I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion,16
Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me,12
and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician,18

Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race,23
With two people,4
big &amp; over,5
Word is that,3
despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads,16
I had a massive victory in Florida,12
Numbers out soon,4
A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false,32
I will bring our jobs back to the U.S.,11
and keep our companies from leaving,10
Nobody else can do it,7
"Our economy will ""sing"" again",10
In presidential voting so far,9
John Kasich is ZERO for 22,10
So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him,16
I will beat Hillary,6
Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico,11
now losing Ford (and many others),9
Kasich is weak on illegal immigration,12
We need strong borders now,6
Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy,22
Remember him in second debate,9
until I put him down,6

Don't reward Mitt Romney,6
who let us all down in the last presidential race,13
by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA,12
open borders etc.),8
Please remember,4
I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign,16
Kasich,2
Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists,15
I will bring our jobs back to America,12
fix our military and take care of our vets,14
end Common Core and ObamaCare,9
protect 2nd A,5
build WALL,2
Rubio is weak on illegal immigration,13
with the worst voting record in the U.S,11
Senate in many years,6
He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,12
Kasich voted for NAFTA,7
a disaster for Ohio,8
and now wants the even worse TPP approved,12
Vote Trump and end this madness,7
Sadly,2
this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan,13
There is nothing nice about it,8

Gov.Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television,32
he only watches the @GolfChannel,10
Ohio Gov.Kasich voted for NAFTA,11
from which Ohio has never recovered,11
Now he wants TPP,6
which will be even worse,6
Ohio steel and coal dying,8
Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events,23
Be careful Bernie,5
or my supporters will go to yours,9
Wow,1
Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania,17
not enough signatures,6

He has ties to ISIS,6

either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified,17
And finally,4
"Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and ""choice"" - a total lie",32
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz,37
Fraud,1
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud,18
Also,2
Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters,20
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus,11
Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race,17
and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz,8
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa,8

John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed,18
bringing down the world and ruining people's lives,12
A total failure,5
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president,14
and opened his mouth,5
people realized he was a complete &amp; total dud,15
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare,20
and the people of Ohio are suffering for it,14
Shame,1
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he’s almost last,31
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates,11
but it was easy—he came in dead last,10
Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down,25
People from NH are smart,6
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun,23
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich,12
but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money,21
John Kasich,3
despite being Governor of Ohio,11
is losing to me in the Ohio polls,11
Pathetic,3
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image,22
not negative ads on me,7
Governor Kasich,5
whose failed campaign &amp; debating skills have brought him way down in the polls,18
is going to spend $2.5 million against me,16

If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate,23
BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered,12
Marco Rubio will not win,8
Weak on illegal immigration,9
"strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a ""lightweight""",21
I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other,20
Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor,19
"Jeb's new slogan - ""Jeb can fix it""",8
I never thought of Jeb as a crook,9
Stupid message,4
"the word ""fix"" is not a good one to use in politics",14
"Anybody that believes in strong borders and stopping illegal immigration cannot vote for Marco Rubio READ THIS: https://t.co/Tj85IsBPG8""",52
Further proof that Gang of Eight member Marco Rubio is weak on illegal immigration is Paul Singer's,28

John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail,12
I thought he would have been far more talented,11
He is just wasting time &amp; money,10
@thehill John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show,28
"I said ""NO THANKS"" Waste of time &amp; energy",12
Few people know that @FortuneMagazine is still in business,17

So sad,2
I have been leading big in all polls,9
with two more today,5
@nbc and @CNN,9
The NBC poll is more than double next,11
at 29%,6
Fiorina has 11%,10
There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems,28
Boxer killed her for Senate in California,12
I will be on @meetthepress at 10:30,12
@nbc will be releasing their new poll numbers,14
Based on the debate results,7
I should do well-who knows?,6

Christians need support in our country (and around the world),15
their religious liberty is at stake,10
Obama has been horrible,8
I will be great,4
If I would have challenged the man,8
the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech,21
A no win situation,7
If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president,22
do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance,14
This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something,22
Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so,39

Everyone is talking about the incredible event we had in Dallas last night,22
Spectacular crowd &amp; arena,10
Thank you @mcuban,6
@club4growth asked me for $1 million,12
I said no,3
Now falsely advertising that I will raise taxes,13
I’ll lower big league for middle class,10
My plan will lower taxes for our country,12
not raise them,3
Phony @club4growth says I will raise taxes—just another lie,17
"Little respected Club For Growth asked me for $1000000 - I said ""NO""",19
Now they are spending lobbyist and special interest money on ads,18
Am now in L.A,5
Will be going to the U.S.S,9

even though the subject was an unpleasant one,12
the horrible Iran Nuke deal,8
Amazing crowd and enthusiasm,10

I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists &amp; special interests for Jeb &amp; others are starting to do big ads—desperate,33

Tomorrow in DC: 1 PM West Front Lawn of the Capitol,17
Not even believable that we would do this deal with Iran,16
Look forward to being in DC tomorrow—big crowd expected for our protest against the truly stupid nuclear deal we are making with Iran,40
Looking forward to being with @SenTedCruz at our big rally in D.C,21
on Wednesday (1:00 P.M,8
at the Capitol) to protest insane Iran nuke deal,14
Both Washington D.C,6
and DALLAS are turning out to be really big events,14
D.C,2
is protest of incompetent Iran deal and Dallas is big speech,17
Remember,3
I'll see you in D.C,6

@club4growth should release the letter they sent me asking for $1000000,21
When I said no,4
they came out against me,6
A scam operation?,6
I will be in Washington D.C,9
"on Wednesday,1 P.M.,in front of the Capitol",13
to protest the horrible and incompetent deal being made with Iran,19
The Dallas event on September 14 at 6:00 P.M,17
at the American Airlines Center looks like it will be a giant success,20
Tickets are going FAST,6
Our country needs a president with great leadership skills and vision,18
not someone like Hillary or Barack,10
neither of which has a clue,7
The phony Club For Growth,6
which asked me in writing for $1000000 (I said no),15
is now wanting to do negative ads on me,12
Total hypocrites,5

I am only working for the people of the U.S.,14
Remember that I am self-funding my campaign,12
Hillary,3
Jeb and the rest are spending special interest and lobbyist money.100% CONTROLLED,25
Hillary said such nasty things about me,11
read directly off her teleprompter...but there was no emotion,17
no truth,2
Just can't read speeches,5
Hillary Clinton made a speech today using the biggest teleprompter I have ever seen,24
In fact,2
it wasn't even see through glass,8
it was black,3
"Saudi Arabia was ""vehemently"" against the Iran nuclear deal",20
Then today they embraced it,7
What happened? What did we give them to endorse?,11
"Just announced that because of ""Trump""",8
advertising rates for debate on @CNN are going from $5000 to $200000,30
a 4000% increase.PAY CHARITY?,12
Why would a very low ratings radio talk show host like Hugh Hewitt be doing the next debate on @CNN,30

When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1000000,23
they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been,14
The president of the pathetic Club For Growth came to my office in N.Y.C,21
and asked for a ridiculous $1000000 contribution,17
I said no way,4
Every Poll has me winning BIG.If you listen to dopey Karl Rove,18
a Trump hater,4

you would think I'm doing poorly,8
@FoxNews,3
Why does @oreillyfactor and @FoxNews always have Karl Rove on,18
He spent $430 million and lost ALL races,17
A dope who said Romney won election,10
I’m turning down millions of dollars of campaign contributions—feel totally stupid doing so,26
but hope it is appreciated by the voters,13

Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast,20
While millions are being spent against me in attack ads,14
they are paid for by the “bosses” and “owners” of candidates,15
I am self funding,5
Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists &amp; special interests,24
Bad system,3
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign,17
Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?,18
The just released Public Policy Polling (PPP - national result) is the best yet,23
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,8
Just out - new PPP NATIONAL POLL has me in first place by a wide margin at 29%,26
I wonder why only @FoxNews has not reported this? Too bad,17
150 Clinton E-mails still contain classified information,20
More sensitive when she was Sec.of State,10
This is a very big deal,7

he would have lost in a landslide,8
He and Graham ZERO in polls,8
"Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a ""fence."" It's not a fence",20
Jeb,1
it's a WALL,3
and there's a BIG difference,7
Asians are very offended that JEB said that anchor babies applies to them as a way to be more politically correct to hispanics,37
A mess,2
"In a clumsy move to get out of his ""anchor babies"" dilemma",17
where he signed that he would not use the term and now uses it,15
he blamed ASIANS,4
Jeb Bush never uses his last name on advertising,14
signage,2
materials etc,8
Is he ashamed of the name BUSH? A pretty sad situation,16
Go Jeb,2

GREATNESS,2
Jeb Bush has a photoshopped photo for an ad which gives him a black left hand and much different looking body,28
Jeb just can't get it right,6
Jeb Bush is weak on illegal immigration,12
in favor of common core,7
bad on women's health issues and thinks the Iraq war was a good thing,17
Now that I started my war on illegal immigration and securing the border,22
most other candidates are finally speaking up,13
Just politicians,5
It has just been confirmed by the City of Mobile,13
Alabama,4
that there were 30000 people at last nights event,14

How is Bernie Sanders going to defend our country if he can't even defend his own microphone? Very sad,30
Thank you to the @washingtonpost for the accurate and very discriptive story on my speech in Alabama last night,32
It was a great evening,6
"I had 15000 people in Phoenix but @politico said ""the rooms capacity is just over 2000."" But said Bernie Sanders had 11000 in same room",47
@politico covers me more inaccurately than any other media source,23
and that is saying something,7
They go out of their way to distort truth,10

amazing people,5
30000 folks was largest crowd of political season,16

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening,32
What were they thinking?,5
Our country is totally fractured and,11
with our weak leadership in Washington,11
you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places,18
Sadly,2
because president Obama has done such a poor job as president,18
you won't see another black president for generations,15
As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S,18
economically,5
they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson,19
Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S,30
as they watch the Ferguson riot,9
If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite,21
you would still be having the riots right now,11
Despite having a black president,9
the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a leader,22
this would not be the case,6
Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots,31
Not smart,2
Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal,25
Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators,15
ISIS is starting its own currency,10
May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented,20

I don't think President changed people's minds - must hope for a lifeline from Putin,19
a very dangerous lifeline at that,10
We will have to see what Russia's next move will be,12
They may have given him an out of an embarrassing situation or drove into deeper mess,25
He is working hard and for that he must be given credit,15
Doesn't want to remove Assad - worries what comes next,13

Celebrity Apprentice will be LIVE on Sunday at 9 PM (from New York City).Casting has already begun for next season,34
In other words,4
our military has a very big problem,13
Unfortunately with some men when the poison kicks in (not me of course) there are no rules or guidelines in the military that will stop them,35
I was never a fan of Bush 2 FOR MANY REASONS,14
including the fact that we should never have gone into Iraq but once there,19
kept the oil,3
DUMB,1

"Many generals and military leaders are now saying ""I told you so!"" They say this will have big impact on military strength &amp; national sec",40
General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control,36
Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife.What is going on?,43
America's top Army general has warned of a crisis unless sexual abuse in the military is quickly brought undet control.Forces greatly hurt,42

What do you think of water boarding the Boston killer sometime prior to allowing our doctors to make him well? I suspect he may talk,36
Make the Boston killer talk before our doctors make him better,17

Don't forget to watch Celebrity Apprentice tonight at 9pm...you will love it,22

He was in perfect shape,6
If the Boston killer applies for Obama Care the paperwork will be too complicated for him to understand,30
NO MERCY TO TERRORISTS you dumb bastards,11
Can you imagine the Boston killer being lovingly tended to in a hospital room right next to his victims who lost their arms,34
legs and worse,3

@NextLevelStoner Great,7
You are right,3
the media is always offending Donald Trump-they have no limits-but they will do anything not to offend the Boston killer,34
I know some of you may think l'm tough and harsh but actually I'm a very compassionate person (with a very high IQ) with strong common sense,39
Didn't the Boston killer even run over his own brother with a car in order to get away? We are not dealing with an innocent baby here-DEATH,40
When the stupid people start feeling sorry for the Boston killer and want to release him and give him medals,28
remember the killings-maimings,8
I hate when the news media,8
so afraid to offend anyone,9
"always refers to the BOSTON KILLER as ""the suspect""",14
The shirts and ties at Macy's are so good-beautiful and do so well that guys like the one that sued me wrongly want a piece-l kicked his ass,34

Get ALL the info,5
then quick trial,4
then death penalty for the Boston killer of innocent children and people,20

IMO--- Manti Te’o was involved in a hoax for sympathy to get the Heisman Trophy,23
Can it just be new age that Manti Te’o fell in love with a girl he never met or is it a hoax?,26

He is either very stupid...,8

that is really bad,5
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction,32
Interestingly,5
the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding,26
People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country,22

the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama,15
It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama,21

How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi? And he continues to lie to the public,31
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?,30
Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy,19
How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi?,16
Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say,27
If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records,19
he would have refused,5

A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to,25
The onus is on Obama to first release his records,15
President Obama,6
if it is important to you,8
I will substantially increase the $5M offer,15
President Obama,6
please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow,15
It is so easy and could do so much good,11

Scary,2
Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years,34

Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition? Hiding something?,35
@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres.Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity,42

Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy http://t.co/6rzfGjMM Pretty generous,54
Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit,28
All he did is say O.K,7
I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi,25
CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs,21
Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see,28
Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart,19
In a couple of years,6
he will thank me,4
Be smart,2
Robert,2
Obama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack,28
especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden,15
"""This is my last election",7
"After my election I have more flexibility."" Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal",34
Obama planted that @nytimes story on Iran so it will be discussed in tonight's debate,25
He wants Libya and China off the table,12
The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork,20
I keep the atrium impeccable,10
Key to its success,5
@Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan,20
He drove you insane but,6
of course,2
Piers is a lot smarter than you,8
My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling,27
I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy,16
Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans,32
@Toure,2
when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage,21
stop by and say hello,6
Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism,32
We lose nothing to try,6
Lots of autism and vaccine response,10
Stop these massive doses immediately,11
Go back to single,5
spread out shots,3
What do we have to lose,6
"Via @politico: ""Donald Trump claims Barack Obama bombshell"" http://t.co/7UZEL9a0",38
Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday. ,17
People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda),17
Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work,9
It makes you hungry,5
Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community &amp; are very expensive &amp; unreliable,42
I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight,13
Derek,2
get well soon,3
the @Yankees need youl,6
Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama,14
"""They succeed",3
"because they think they can."" -- Virgil",8
Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic,25
The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go,24
Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack,13
Respect the wounded and dead,7
Good luck to Derek on his operation,11
I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion,15
Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately,17
It will be lucky for him like in past,10
Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower,22
7.8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday.Real unemployment is at least 15%,45
@MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget,22
Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt,19
What a surprise,4
No surprise,3
welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama,17
"http://t.co/pHREg2Cj He is the food stamp &amp; welfare ""king""",25
Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which,11
under Graydon Carter,6

Franklin Graham,4
Rev.@BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney,35
Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night,20
A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season,19
They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner,14
I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did,26
You can't do any worse,6
@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there &amp; worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio,32
@RickyTheBitch @ladygaga I think Gaga is great--her 1st major appearance at my Miss Universe Pageant in Vietnam/6 yrs ago Should give me 25%,49
Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead,16
Mitt will pull away next week,7
"Obama has called Libya attack ""a bump in the road"" and ""not optimal."" Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth",33
Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year,20
Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC,11
Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday,19

Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines? Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it,34
@JakfromBk Thanks,4
@MisterJoe49 @Yankees I agree,13
but their careers weren't fueled by drugs,10
"Obama said ""not optimal"" to Ambassador &amp; embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate",31
@MittRomney did a great job last night,10
Watch the clip,3
http://t.co/a1muA6zj,18
@evaemery Never give up,9
You have what it takes,5
Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell,14
I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall,13
With Barry Diller &amp; Tina Brown in charge,12
did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure?,16
It is a great honor to have helped the community so much,16
http://t.co/ZC0boYWu,17
Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche--much like our President,21
@Yankees should get rid of A-Rod ASAP--I can't watch this guy anymore,21
@evaemery Thanks--you sound great,9
@Rosie @realDonaldTrump Thanks for the info Rosie--get well,17

How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects?,22
Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right,18
the economy has not been fixed under Obama.I always said Bill was an honest man,24
When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money,17
will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good?,17
Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states,22
Their internals must be horrendous,9
While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars,20
ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room.She is back,23
Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment,14
Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you,15
Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins,14
If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year,11
the fans will be happy,6
I think the @yankees will win today,10
Unlike A-Rod,4
CC is good under pressure,8

We should be given credit for taking this risk,12
Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight?,34
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart,13
She cheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again--just watch,17
He can do much better,6
Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback,25

Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles,30
@BillRancic Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald,16
Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters,12
even A-Rod,4
they got you there,4
While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished,13
they won't quit for CC,6
Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded,15
But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout http://t.co/ocd4ZHlD He is very selfish,33
Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it,22
especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary,17
@MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style,13
"""Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries"" http://t.co/VAisvQlh via @Newsmax_Media",46
Bad decisions can be devastating,10
Obama was beaten but not knocked out,10
He lives to fight another day,8
But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance..,16
All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board,19
Mitt will remember the early helpers,10
If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically,24
environmentally &amp; aesthetically,12
Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines &amp; how destructive they are,30
Windmills are a disaster,7
Remember,3
"new ""environment friendly"" lightbulbs can cause cancer",13
Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care,15
Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds,13
they are killing the finances &amp; environment of many countries &amp; communities,25

Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama,13
Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win,15
Don't put it past him,5
Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively,19
Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night? I don't,28
Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal,15
If we do not win energy as a country,12
we just do not win,5
period,3
I still love Derek,5
he is a winner,5
Remember,3
I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment...its been lucky for you,20
The day after he sold it,7
he broke his foot,4
At the debate,4
the President kept talking of what he is going to do,15
I kept saying,4
why didn't he do it? He lost me a long time ago,14
Verlander pitched great,5
but @Yankees look truly defeated,10
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago,15
Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy,16
"George Will said ""best debate he ever saw""",10
If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting,17
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other,11
At one point it looked like they would come to blows. ,11
Obama better than last time,8
but again,3
@MittRomney wins,5
Good night,2
#debate,4
You talk tough,3
Mr,2
President,3
but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy,19
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama,15
No wonder nothing gets done,7
@MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems,17
Obama has no answer,7
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton,16
Obama weak on immigration,9
All words,2
no action,3
He's been Prez 4 years,5
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak,12
@MittRomney is looking strong and sharp,10
"Obama just said @MittRomney was ""a very successful investor""--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility",39
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk,22
@MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential,15
Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices?,14
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney,10
Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?,15
Why hasn't Obama created jobs?,10
"Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say ""let's get ready to rumble""",19
I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country,28
Very nice compliment--I agree,9
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would,36
@drumline_mormon It is selling great at Macy's--thanks,17
For political purposes only,10
Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election?,28
Great win last night by Peyton Manning &amp; @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road,36
Very impressive,5
If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series,23
And I will go to games 6&amp; 7 so they will win,15
Get ready for tonight,6
@MissUSA Olivia--we love you,11
You are doing a great job,7
@MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records &amp; transcripts--he will quiet down quickly,31
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great,15
Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud,24
@DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice,16
I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi,38

Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President,23
@reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves,27
@antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep,12
"@History's wonderful ""The Men Who Built America"" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing",25
I'll be live tweeting the debate,8
Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate,15
tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real,20
The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay,17
I'll still keep drinking that garbage,8
It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings,28
And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks,10
Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row,24
At least he is consistent,7
Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit,12
I wish the stuff worked,5
@antbaxter Thanks for helping promote &amp; make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool,31
@antbaxter Your documentary died many deaths,14
You have,2
in my opinion,5
zero talent,4
I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic,11
my first season winner,6
will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice,18
@rupertmurdoch is absolutely right,11
it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected,20
Verlander is great but very beatable,11
Does not have a good ERA in playoff games,11
I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers,25
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight,13
We'll all be watching @MittRomney,9
Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod,16
If he doesn't perform well it could be over,12
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt,24

Once again Obama fails to classify China as a currency manipulator,23
He just helped China steal even more jobs and money from us,15
A-Rod should donate his contract to charity,12
He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform,18
He is a $30M/yr rip off,12
Looking forward to speaking at tonight's gala for @MittRomney supporters at the Intrepid,25
Mitt's doing well,4
Barack Obama is not who you think he is,12
Most overrated politician in US history,14
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess,27
He is not who you think,6
Lots of response to my comment on Diet Coke- let's face it,15
it doesn't work- just makes you hungry,9
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice,24
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?,35
I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people,14
A-Rod is just not making it,8
We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great,17
Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing,23
Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks,23
@MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good,13
One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout. ,17
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke,14
No,1

A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat,8
Time for him to step up and leave,8
Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night,11
@Yankees are in trouble without Derek,11
Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence,11
A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion,20
So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose,16
Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away,22
Scrape and paint before too late,7
Tonight,2
despite everything,5
put A-Rod in the lineup. ,7
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod,11
Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. ,24
They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer,24
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series,18
I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win,28
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won,16
"When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say "" what were we doing""",26

"""What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy."" --@PaulRyanVP",31
